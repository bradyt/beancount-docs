<p><em>A discussion about how to carry out fund accounting within Beancount,
various approaches, solutions and possible extensions.</em></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Multiple users are attempting to solve the problem of fund accounting
using command-line accounting systems, partially because this type of
accounting occurs in the context of non-profit organizations that have
small budgets and would prefer to use free software, and partially
because the flexibility and customization required appear to be a good
fit for command-line bookkeeping systems.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-fund-accounting">What is Fund Accounting?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-fund-accounting" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>For example, see <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ledger-cli/N8Slh2t45K0/nu1ZACCueQYJ"><span class="underline">this
thread</span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Another religious duty I compute is effectively tithing (we call it
Huqúqu'lláh, and it's computed differently, but that's another story).
In order to compute the tithe owed, I accrue 19% of every deposit to a
virtual account, and then subtract from that account 19% of every
needful expenditure.</em></p>
<p><em>The total remaining at the end of the year is what I owe in tithe.
This tithing account is not a real account, as it exists in no
financial institution; but it is real enough as a personal duty. By
using virtual account, I can track this "side-band" Liability, and
then pay it off from an assets account when the time comes. If I
report with --real I will simply see how much I've paid to this
Liability; and if I report without --real I see how much Huqúqu'lláh
is presently owed.”</em></p>
<p><em>— John Wiegley</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s another description, as a comment from another user:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>[...] basically the idea that you split your financial life into
separate pots called "funds". Each fund has its own chart of accounts
(to a certain extent) and each fund obeys Assets+Liabilities+Equities
== 0. This is often needed in non-profits where money given for
specific purposes has to be accounted separately. The one area of
non-separation is that actual asset accounts (e.g. bank accounts) and
actual liability accounts (credit cards) may hold or owe money on
behalf of multiple funds, so you can't use entirely separate ledger
files. At our church we use a program called PowerChurchPlus for this
and it works really well. My wife is now treasurer for a community
music organization and facing the same problem but on such a small
scale that the cost of a commercial program isn't warranted.</em></p>
<p><em>I've seen what was posted in the ledger-cli list about non-profit
accounting using C++ ledger and it just looks like it requires way too
much discipline to use the tags correctly and consistently. The fund
idea is much easier to explain and use (and the balance account
invariant naturally enforced). So I was looking at the Beancount code
to see whether I could adapt it to support fund accounting. I think
the answer is "yes and relatively easily so". Furthermore, I think
this idea has uses even for individuals: a couple of scenarios present
themselves. First, I live in a community property state. My wife and I
are each likely to inherit property which will be ours individually,
but we also have the community property. These can each be treated as
a separate fund and we will be able to report on them separately but
also together for understanding our overall financial situation.
Similarly, it potentially makes sense to account for retirement money
with a separate fund for each person.</em></p>
<p><em>— Carl Hauser</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the PowerChurchPlus 11.5 Manual (PowerChurch, Inc. 2013):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In accounting, the term fund has a very specific meaning. An
Accounting Fund is a self-balancing Chart of Accounts. [...] In
accounting we need to think of a fund as a division, or sub-group of
your church. Each Accounting Fund has its own assets, liabilities,
equity, income, transfer and expense accounts.</em></p>
<p><em>So when would you use an additional fund? If you have an area of your
church that needs to produce its own reporting, you would need to use
an additional fund. For example, if your church operates a preschool
or play school, you might want to set up an additional fund to keep
their finances separate from the church's. Depending on your needs,
you might want to setup a separate fund for the men's or women's
group. You might even setup a new fund to keep track of all fixed
assets separately from the daily operating accounts.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an interesting and apparently common problem. We will describe
use cases in the rest of this section.</p>
<h3 id="joint-account-management">Joint Account Management<a class="headerlink" href="#joint-account-management" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>I have personally used this “fund accounting” idea to manage a joint
account that I had with my ex-wife, where we would both hold individual
accounts—we were both working professionals— and chip in to the joint
account as needed. This section describes how I did this<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The accounting for the joint account was held in a separate file. Two
sub-accounts were created to hold each of our “portions”:</p>
<pre><code>2010-01-01 open Assets:BofA:Joint         
2010-01-01 open Assets:BofA:Joint:Martin  
2010-01-01 open Assets:BofA:Joint:Judie
</code></pre>
<p>Transfers to the joint account were directly booked into one of the two
sub-account:</p>
<pre><code>2012-09-07 * "Online Xfer Transfer from CK 345"
  Assets:BofA:Joint:Judie          1000.00 USD
  Income:Contributions:Judie
</code></pre>
<p>When we would incur expenses, we would reduce the asset account with two
legs, one for each subaccount. We often booked them 2:1 to account for
difference in income, or I just booked many of the transactions to
myself (the fact that it was precisely accounted for does not imply that
we weren’t being generous to each other in that way):</p>
<pre><code>2013-04-27 * "Urban Vets for Grumpy"
  Expenses:Medical:Cat           100.00 USD
  Assets:BofA:Joint:Martin          -50 USD
  Assets:BofA:Joint:Judie           -50 USD

2013-05-30 * "Takahachi"  "Dinner"
  Expenses:Food:Restaurant        65.80 USD
  Assets:BofA:Joint:Judie        -25.00 USD
  Assets:BofA:Joint:Martin
</code></pre>
<p>It was convenient to elide one of the two amounts, as we weren’t being
very precise about this.</p>
<h3 id="handling-multiple-funds">Handling Multiple Funds<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-multiple-funds" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p><em>(Contributed from Carl Hauser)</em></p>
<p>Here’s the model used in the PowerChurchPlus system that is mentioned
above (replacing the account numbers it uses with Beancount-style
names). “Fund” names are <em>prefixed</em> to the account names.</p>
<pre><code>Operations:Assets:Bank:...
Endowment:Assets:Bank:...
Operations:Liabilities:CreditCard:...
Endowment:Liabilities:CreditCard:...
Operations:Income:Pledges:2014
Operations:Expenses:Salaries:...
Operations:Expenses:BuildingImprovement:...
Endowment:Income:Investments:...
Endowment:Expenses:BuildingImprovement:...
…
</code></pre>
<p>It is required that any transaction be balanced in every fund that it
uses. For example, our Endowment fund often helps pay for things that
are beyond the reach of current donations income.</p>
<pre><code>2014-07-25 * "Bill’s Audio" "Sound system upgrade"
   Endowment:Assets:Bank1:Checking        800.00 USD
   Operations:Assets:Bank1:Checking       200.00 USD
   Endowment:Expenses:BuildingImprovement:Sound -800.00 USD
   Operations:Expenses:BuildingImprovement:Sound -200.00 USD
</code></pre>
<p>This represents a single check to Bill’s Audio paid from assets of both
the Endowment and Operations funds that are kept in the single external
assets account Assets:Bank1:Checking.</p>
<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> An empty fund name could be allowed and the following “:”
omitted, and in fact could be the default for people who don’t want to
use these features. (i.e., nothing changes if you don’t use these
features.) The Fund with the empty string for its name is, of course,
distinct from all other Funds.</p>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> balance and pad directives are not very useful with accounts
that participate in more than one Fund. Their use would require knowing
the allocation of the account between the different funds and account
statements from external holders (banks, e.g.) will not have this
information. It might be useful to allow something like</p>
<pre><code>2014-07-31 balance *:Assets:Bank1:Checking     579.39 USD
</code></pre>
<p>as a check that things were right, but automatically correcting it with
pad entries seems impossible.</p>
<p>A balance sheet report can be run on any Fund <em>or any combination of
Funds</em> and it will balance. You can keep track of what is owned for each
different purpose easily. Transfers between funds are booked as expenses
and decreases in the assets of one fund and income and increases in
assets of the other. The income and expense accounts used for transfers
may be generic (Operations:Income:Transfer) or you can use accounts set
up for a particular kind of income or expense
(Endowment:Expense:BuildingImprovement:Sound) would be fine as one leg
of a transfer transaction.</p>
<p>The account name syntax here is just one way it might work and relies on
Beancount’s use of five specifically-named top-level accounts. Anything
to the left of the first of those could be treated as a fund name, or a
different separator could be used between the fund part and the account
name part. Similarly, I’ve only shown single-level fund names but they
might be hierarchical as well. I’m not sure of the value of that, but
observe that if transactions balance at the leaf-level funds they will
also balance for funds higher in the hierarchy and there might be some
mileage there.</p>
<p>For John W.’s <em>Huqúqu'lláh</em> example one might set up a Fund whose
liabilities were “moral obligations” rather than legal ones (that seems
to be the objection to simply tracking the tithes in an ordinary
liability account). As income comes in (say, direct deposited in a real
bank checking account), book 19% of it to the “moral obligation” fund’s
checking account with a matching liability. When needful expenses are
made, take back 19% from the “moral obligation” fund’s checking account
and reduce the liability. No virtual postings or transactions --
everything must balance. This would work well if for example we were to
have a HisRetirement fund and a HerRetirement fund -- useful to have
separate for estate planning purposes -- but more commonly we want to
know about our combined retirement which could be defined to be a
<em>virtual</em> fund OurRetirement equal to the sum of HisRetirement and
HerRetirement. Note that this only matters when creating reports: there
is no need to do anything except normal, double-entry booking with
balanced transactions in each <em>real</em> fund. When I say the “sum” of two
funds I mean a combination of taking the union of the contained account
names, after stripping off the fund names, then summing the balances of
the common accounts and keeping the balances of the others.</p>
<p><em>(Balance Sheet)</em> For reporting, one wants the capability for balance by
fund and balance summed over a set of funds. I also use a report that
shows a subset of funds, one per column, with corresponding account
names lined up horizontally and a column at the right that is the “sum”.
When all funds are included in this latter report you get a complete
picture of what you own and owe and what is set aside for different
purposes, or restricted in different ways. Here’s a small sample of a
balance sheet for a subset of the church Funds. The terminology is a
little different: what Beancount calls Equity is here Net Assets. And
because using large numbers of Funds in PowerChurchPlus is not so easy,
the NetAssets are actually categorized for different purposes -- this is
where I think the ideas we’re exploring here can really shine: if Funds
are really easy to create and combine for reporting then some of the
mechanisms that PCP has for divvying up assets within a fund become
unnecessary.

<p><em>(Income Statement)</em> For the Income and Expense report, usually I only
care about expenses in one Fund at a time, but adding two funds together
makes perfect sense if that’s what you need to do.</p>
<p>For me, this approach to fund accounting is appealing because it relies
on and preserves the fundamental principles of double-entry bookkeeping:
when transactions sum to 0 the balance sheet equation is always true.
Out of this we automatically get the ability to combine <em>any set of
funds</em> (we don’t have to do anything special when entering transactions
or organizing the deep structure of the accounts) and have it make at
least arithmetical sense, and we don’t rely on any “magic” associated
with renaming or tagging. I don’t see how this can be so easily or
neatly achieved by pushing the idea of the “funds” down into the account
hierarchy: funds belong <em>above</em> the five root accounts (Assets,
Liabilities, Equity, Income and Expenses), not below them.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-for-implementation">Ideas for Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#ideas-for-implementation" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p><strong><em>Some random ideas for now. This needs a bit more work.</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If multiple redundant postings are required, the generation of these
    can be <strong>automated using a <a href="../23_beancount_scripting_plugins/"><span
    class="underline">plugin</span></a></strong>.
    For instance, if a technique similar to <a href="http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/mirror"><span
    class="underline">mirror
    accounting</span></a> is used in
    order to “send the same dollars to multiple accounts”, at least the
    user should not have to do this manually, which would be both
    tedious and prone to errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A procedure to <strong>rename accounts</strong> upon parsing could be used, in
    order to merge multiple files into one. (Allowing the user to
    install such a mapping is an idea I’ve had for a while but never
    implemented, though it could be implemented by a plugin filter.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can rely on the fact that the transactions of <strong>subaccounts may
    be joined and summed in a parent account</strong> (despite the fact that
    reporting is lagging behind in that matter at the moment. It will be
    implemented eventually).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building off the earlier remark about doing something similar to the
    tag stack for Funds. What if the current tag architecture were
    extended to allow tags to have a value, #fund=Operations, or
    #fund=Endowment. Call them value-tags. You would also need to allow
    postings to have tags. Semantics of value-tags would be that they
    could only occur once for any posting, that a tag explicitly on a
    posting overrides the value-tag inherited from the transaction, and
    that an explicit tag on a transaction overrides a value from the
    tag-stack, and that only the last value-tag (with a particular key)
    in the tag-stack is applied to a transaction. This makes Funds a
    little less first-class than the earlier proposal to stick them in
    front of account names, but gets around the minor parsing difficulty
    previously mentioned. It suggests that opening of accounts within
    funds is not necessary where the previous syntax suggests that it
    is. The strict balancing rule for each fund in a transaction can
    still be implemented as a plugin. And reporting for a fund (or sum
    of funds) looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>select transactions with any posting matching the desired fund
    (or funds)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collect (and sum if necessary in the obvious way) postings
    associated with the fund (or funds) being reported on (A)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>collect (and sum in the obvious way) postings from the selected
    transactions not associated with the desired fund (B)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Format a report with (A) as the information for the desired fund
    or funds and (B) as OTHER. OTHER is needed to make sure that the
    report balances, but could be omitted by choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<pre><code>From an implementation perspective this seems more orthogonal to the current status quo, requiring even less change to existing code. It adds a new feature -- value tags and that can then be used by plugins and new reports to do what we want for fund accounting.

<h2 id="examples">Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p><em>(Carl)</em> Here is an example of how I might try to handle things
associated with my paycheck, which involves deferred compensation
(403(b) -- extremely similar to a 401(k)) and a Flexible Spending
Account (somewhat similar to an HSA which has been discussed previously
on the ledger-cli group).</p>
<h3 id="without-funds">Without Funds<a class="headerlink" href="#without-funds" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>(Carl) First, without Funds (this passes a bean-check):</p>
<p>This is how I might set up my pay stub with health insurance, an FSA and
403b contributions in the absence of Funds. One problem is that it
distributes Gross Income directly into the 403b and FSA accounts even
though it recognizes that the health insurance contribution is a
reduction in salary which the 403b and FSA ought to be as well. So
tracking contributions to both of those is made more difficult as well
as tracking taxable income.</p>
<p>By thinking hard we could fix this -- we would come up with Income and
Expense type accounts to represent the contributions, but they would end
up looking kind of silly (in my opinion) because they are entirely
internal to the accounts system.</p>
<p>See the next example for how it would look using Funds. If you stick out
your tongue, rub your tummy and stand on your head you will see that the
Funds-based solution is equivalent to what we would have come up with in
the paragraph above in terms of the complexity of its transactions --
just as many lines are required. The advantage is primarily a mental one
-- it is much easier to see what to do to be both consistent and useful.</p>

<h3 id="using-funds">Using Funds<a class="headerlink" href="#using-funds" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>(Carl) And now using Funds (uses proposed features and hence can’t be
checked by bean-check):</p>
<p>This is how I might set up my pay stub with health insurance, an FSA and
403b contributions using Funds. I can straightforwardly arrange things
so that contributions to the FSA and 403b are recognized as salary
reductions for income tax purposes. And I can easily see how much I have
contributed to the 403b and how much my employer has contributed.</p>
<p>See the previous example for how it would look without using Funds and
which is not as accurate.</p>
<p>What this does NOT do is track taxes ultimately owed on the 403b money.
I think that is a matter of one's decision about whether to do
cash-basis or accrual-basis accounting. If cash basis those taxes are
not a current liability and cannot be reported as such. If accrual
basis, they are a current liability and need to be recorded as such when
the income is booked.</p>
<p>For cash-basis books, we'd want the ability to report the state of
affairs as if taxes were owed, but that is a matter for reporting rather
than booking. We need to make sure we have enough identifiable
information to automate creating those reports. I believe that taking a
Fund-based accounting perspective easily does this.</p>
<p>A problem not solved: what if your basis is different for Federal and
State purposes, or even for Federal and multiple different states.
Yikes!</p>
<p>I've used the convention that the Fund name precedes the root account
name. Note that with appropriate standing on one's head along with
pivoting rules you can put the Fund name anywhere. Putting it first
emphasizes that it identifies a set of accounts that must balance, and
it makes it easy for the txn processor to guarantee this property.
Accounts without a fund name in front belong to the Fund whose name is
the empty string.</p>

<p>One problem that I’ve experienced using the Fund approach is that it’s a
bit too easy to make mistakes when transferring money between funds,
such as in the very last transaction above. Formalizing the idea of
Transfer accounts can help with this. The most common mistake is to end
up with something that moves assets in both accounts in the same
direction -- both up or both down as in this mistaken version of the
transaction in question:</p>
<pre><code>2014-07-20 ! "Medical expense reimbursed from FSA - with mistake"
 Assets:Bank:Checking                            25 USD

 FSA:Expenses:ReimburseMedical
</code></pre>
<p>This balances but isn’t what we intended. Suppose we add the idea of
Transfer accounts. They live at the same place in the hierarchy as
Income and Expenses and like those are non-balance-sheet accounts. But
they really come into play only for transactions that involve multiple
funds. There is an additional rule for transactions containing Transfer
accounts: the sum of the transfers must also be zero (additional in the
sense that the rule about transactions balancing within each fund is
still there). So to use this we set things up a little differently:</p>
<pre><code>2014-07-15 open FSA:Transfer:Incoming:Contribution
2014-07-15 open FSA:Transfer:Outgoing:ReimburseMedical
2014-07-15 open Transfer:Outgoing:FSAContribution
2014-07-15 open Transfer:Incoming:ReimburseMedical
</code></pre>
<p>The incorrect transaction is now flagged because sum of the transfers is
-50 USD, not zero.</p>

<p>Some might think that this is too complicated. Without changing the
Transfer accounts idea or rule, you can simplify booking to just a
single account per fund, Fund:Transfer, losing some ability for
precision in reporting but without losing the ability to check
correctness of transfer transactions.</p>
