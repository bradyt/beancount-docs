<p>This document is a gentle guide to creating your first Beancount file,
initializing it with some options, some guidelines for how to organize
your file, and instructions for declaring accounts and making sure their
initial balance does not raise errors. It also contains some material on
configuring the Emacs text editor, if you use that.</p>
<p>You will probably want to have read some of the <a href="../06_beancount_language_syntax/"><span
class="underline">User’s Manual</span></a>
first in order to familiarize yourself with the syntax and kinds of
available directives, or move on to the <a href="../18_command_line_accounting_cookbook/"><span
class="underline">Cookbook</span></a>
if you’ve already setup a file or know how to do that. If you’re
familiar with Ledger, you may want to read up on the <a href="../15_a_comparison_of_beancount_and_ledger_hledger/"><span
class="underline">differences between Ledger and
Beancount</span></a>
first.</p>

<p>First, you will want a bit of support for your text editor. I’m using
Emacs, so I’ll explain my setup for this, but certainly you can use any
text editor to compose your input file.</p>
<p>Beancount’s Emacs support provides a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Minor-Modes.html"><em><span class="underline">Minor
Mode</span></em></a>
(as opposed to a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Major-Modes.html"><em><span class="underline">Major
Mode</span></em></a>)
on purpose, so that you can combine it with your favorite text editing
mode. I like to use <a href="http://orgmode.org/"><em><span
class="underline">Org-Mode</span></em></a>, which is an
outline mode for Emacs which allows you to fold and unfold its sections
to view the outline of your document. This makes it much easier to edit
a very long text file. (I don’t use Org-Mode’s literal programming
blocks, I only use it to fold and unfold sections of text.)</p>
<p>You can configure Emacs to automatically open files with a “.beancount”
extension to enable beancount-mode by adding this code to your ~/.emacs
file:</p>
<pre><code>(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/beancount/src/elisp")
(require 'beancount)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.beancount\\'" . beancount-mode))
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/tip/editors/emacs/beancount.el"><span
class="underline">Beancount-mode</span></a>
provides some nice editing features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In order to quickly and painlessly insert account names, you need
    completion on the account names. You will probably get frustrated
    with all the typing if you don’t have completion. Beancount-mode
    automatically recognizes account names already present in the input
    file (refresh the list with “C-c r”) and you can insert a new
    account name with ”C-c ‘”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s also nice to align the amounts in a transaction nicely; this
    formatting can be done automatically with “C-c ;” with the cursor on
    the transaction you want to align.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To get started, let’s create a minimal input file with two accounts and
a single transaction. Enter or copy the following input to a text file:</p>
<pre><code>2014-01-01 open Assets:Checking
2014-01-01 open Equity:Opening-Balances

2014-01-02 * "Deposit"

<h2 id="brief-syntax-overview"><a id="brief-syntax-overview"></a>Brief Syntax Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#brief-syntax-overview" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>A few notes and an ultra brief overview of the Beancount syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currencies must be entirely in capital letters (allowing numbers and
    some special characters, like “_” or “-”). Currency symbols (such
    as $ or €) are not supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Account names do not admit spaces (though you can use dashes), and
    must have at least two components, separated by colons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Description strings must be quoted, like this: "AMEX PMNT".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dates are only parsed in ISO8601 format, that is, YYYY-MM-DD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tags must begin with “#”, and links with “^”.</p>
</li>
</ul>

class="underline">User’s
Manual</span></a>.</p>
<h2 id="validating-your-file"><a id="validating-your-file"></a>Validating your File<a class="headerlink" href="#validating-your-file" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The purpose of Beancount is to produce reports from your input file
(either on the console or serve via its web interface). However, there
is a tool that you can use to simply load its contents and make some
validation checks on it, to ensure that your input does not contain
errors. Beancount can be quite strict; this is a tool that you use while
you’re entering your data to ensure that your input file is legal. The
tool is called “bean-check” and you invoke it like this:</p>
<pre><code>bean-check /path/to/your/file.beancount
</code></pre>
<p>Try it now on the file you just created from the previous section. It
should exit with no output. If there are errors, they will be printed on
the console. The errors are printed out in a format that Emacs
recognizes by default, so you can use Emacs’ next-error and
previous-error built-in functions to move the cursor to the location of
the problem.</p>
<h2 id="viewing-the-web-interface"><a id="viewing-the-web-interface"></a>Viewing the Web Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#viewing-the-web-interface" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>A convenient way to view reports is to bring up the “bean-web” tool on
your input file. Try it:</p>
<pre><code>bean-web /path/to/your/file.beancount
</code></pre>
<p>You can then point a web browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080"><span
class="underline">http://localhost:8080</span></a>
and click your way around the various reports generated by Beancount.
You can then modify the input file and reload the web page your browser
is pointing to—bean-web will automatically reload the file contents.</p>
<p>At this point, you should probably read some of the <a href="../06_beancount_language_syntax/"><span
class="underline">Language
Syntax</span></a> document.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-organize-your-file"><a id="how-to-organize-your-file"></a>How to Organize your File<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-organize-your-file" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In this section we provide general guidelines for how to organize your
file. This assumes you’ve read the <a href="../06_beancount_language_syntax/"><span class="underline">Language
Syntax</span></a> document.</p>
<h3 id="preamble-to-your-input-file"><a id="preamble-to-your-input-file"></a>Preamble to your Input File<a class="headerlink" href="#preamble-to-your-input-file" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>I recommend that you begin with just a single file<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. My file has a
header that tells my editor (Emacs) what “mode” to open the file with,
followed by some common options:</p>
<pre><code>;; -*- mode: org; mode: beancount; coding: utf-8; fill-column: 400; -*-
option "title" "My Personal Ledger"
option "operating_currency" "USD"
option "operating_currency" "CAD"
</code></pre>
<p>The title options is used in reports. The list of “operating currencies”
identify those commodities which you use most commonly as “currencies”
and which warrant rendering in their own dedicated columns in reports
(this declaration has no other effect on the behavior of any of the
calculations).</p>
<h3 id="sections-declaring-accounts"><a id="sections-declaring-accounts"></a>Sections &amp; Declaring Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#sections-declaring-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>I like to organize my input file in sections that correspond to each
real-world account. Each section defines all the accounts related to
this real-world account by using an Open directive. For example, this is
a checking account:</p>
<pre><code>2007-02-01 open Assets:US:BofA:Savings              USD
2007-02-01 open Income:US:BofA:Savings:Interest     USD
</code></pre>
<p>I like to declare the currency constraints as much as possible, to avoid
mistakes. Also, note how I declare an income account specific to this
account. This helps break down income in reporting for taxes, as you
will likely receive a tax document in relation to that specific
account’s income (in the US this would be a 1099-INT form produced by
your bank).</p>
<p>Here’s what the opening accounts might look like for an investment
account:</p>
<pre><code>2012-03-01 open Assets:US:Etrade:Main:Cash            USD
2012-03-01 open Assets:US:Etrade:Main:ITOT            ITOT
2012-03-01 open Assets:US:Etrade:Main:IXUS            IXUS
2012-03-01 open Assets:US:Etrade:Main:IEFA            IEFA
2012-03-01 open Income:US:Etrade:Main:Interest        USD

<p>The point is that all these accounts are related somehow. The various
sections of the cookbook will describe the set of accounts suggested to
create for each section.</p>
<p>Not all sections have to be that way. For example, I have the following
sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Eternal accounts.</strong> I have a section at the top dedicated to
    contain special and “eternal” accounts, such as payables and
    receivables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Daybook.</strong> I have a “daybook” section at the bottom that contains
    all cash expenses, in chronological order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expense accounts.</strong> All my expenses accounts (categories) are
    defined in their own section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Employers.</strong> For each employer I’ve defined a section where I put
    the entries for their direct deposits, and track vacations, stock
    vesting and other job-related transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Taxes.</strong> I have a section for taxes, organized by taxation year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can organize it any way you like, because Beancount doesn’t care
about the ordering of declarations.</p>
<h3 id="closing-accounts"><a id="closing-accounts"></a>Closing Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#closing-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If a real-world account has closed, or is never going to have any more
transactions posted to it, you can declare it “closed” at a particular
date by using a Close directive:</p>
<pre><code>; Moving to another bank.
2013-06-13 close Assets:US:BofA:Savings
</code></pre>
<p>This tells Beancount not to show the account in reports that don’t
include any date where it was active. It also avoids errors by
triggering an error if you do try to post to it at a later date.</p>

<p>One problem that will occur frequently is that once you have <a href="../17_importing_external_data/"><span
class="underline">some sort of code or
process</span></a> set up to automatically
extract postings from downloaded files, you will end up importing
postings which provide two separate sides of the same transaction. An
example is the payment of a credit card balance via a transfer from a
checking account. If you download the transactions for your checking
account, you will extract something like this:</p>
<pre><code>2014-06-08 * "ONLINE PAYMENT - THANK YOU"
  Assets:CA:BofA:Checking           -923.24 USD
</code></pre>
<p>The credit card download will yield you this:</p>
<pre><code>2014-06-10 * "AMEX EPAYMENT    ACH PMT"
  Liabilities:US:Amex:Platinum       923.24 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Many times, transactions from these accounts need to be booked to an
expense account, but in this case, these are two separate legs of the
same transaction: a transfer. When you import one of these, you normally
look for the other side and merge them together:</p>
<pre><code>;2014-06-08 * "ONLINE PAYMENT - THANK YOU"
2014-06-10 * "AMEX EPAYMENT    ACH PMT"
  Liabilities:US:Amex:Platinum       923.24 USD
  Assets:CA:BofA:Checking           -923.24 USD
</code></pre>
<p>I often leave one of the description lines in comments—just my choice,
Beancount ignores it. Also note that I had to choose one of the two
dates. I just choose the one I prefer, as long as it does not break any
balance assertion.</p>
<p>In the case that you would forget to merge those two imported
transactions, worry not! That’s what balance assertions are for.
Regularly place a balance assertion in either of these accounts, e.g.,
every time you import, and you will get a nice error if you ended up
entering the transaction twice. This is pretty common and after a while
it becomes second nature to interpret that compiler error and fix it in
seconds.</p>
<p>Finally, when I know I import just one side of these, I select the other
account manually and I mark the posting I know will be imported later
with a flag, which tells me I haven’t de-duped this transaction yet:</p>
<pre><code>2014-06-10 * "AMEX EPAYMENT    ACH PMT"
  Liabilities:US:Amex:Platinum       923.24 USD
  ! Assets:CA:BofA:Checking
</code></pre>
<p>Later on, when I import the checking account’s transactions and go
fishing for the other side of this payment, I will find this and get a
good feeling that the world is operating as it should.</p>
<p>(If you’re interested in more of a discussion around de-duping and
merging transaction, see this <a href="../28_settlement_dates_in_beancount/"><span class="underline">feature

<p>So if you organize your account in sections the way I suggest above,
which section of the file should you leave such “merged” transactions
in, that is, transactions that involve two separate accounts? Well, it’s
your call. For example, in the case of a transfer between two accounts
organized such that they have their own dedicated sections, it would be
nice to be able to leave both transactions there so that when you edit
your input file you see them in either section, but unfortunately, the
transaction must occur in only one place in your document. You have to
choose one.</p>
<p>Personally I’m a little careless about being consistent which of the
section I choose to leave the transaction in; sometimes I choose one
section of my input file, or that of the other account, for the same
pair of accounts. It hasn’t been a problem, as I use Emacs and i-search
liberally which makes it easy to dig around my gigantic input file. If
you want to keep your input more tidy and organized, you could come up
with a rule for yourself, e.g. “credit card payments are always left in
the paying account’s section, not in the credit card account’s section”,
or perhaps you could leave the transaction in both sections and comment
one out<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="padding"><a id="padding"></a>Padding<a class="headerlink" href="#padding" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>If you’re just starting out—and you probably are if you’re reading
this—you will have no historical data. This means that the balances of
your Assets and Liabilities accounts in Beancount will all be zero. But
the first thing you should want to do after defining some accounts is
establish a balance sheet and bring those amounts to their actual
current value.</p>
<p>Let’s take your checking account as an example, say you opened it a
while back. You don’t remember exactly when, so let’s use an approximate
date:</p>
<pre><code>2000-05-28 open Assets:CA:BofA:Checking  USD
</code></pre>
<p>The next thing you do is look up your current balance and put a balance
assertion for the corresponding amount:</p>
<pre><code>2014-07-01 balance Assets:CA:BofA:Checking    1256.35 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Running Beancount on just this will correctly produce an error because
Beancount assumes an implicit balance assertion of “empty” at the time
you open an account. You will have to “pad” your account to today’s
balance by inserting a <em>balance adjustment</em> at some point in time
between the opening and the balance, against some equity account, which
is an arbitrary place to book “where you received the initial balance
from.” For this purpose, this is usually the “Equity:Opening-Balances”
account. So let’s include this padding transaction and recap what we
have so far:</p>
<pre><code>2000-05-28 open Assets:CA:BofA:Checking  USD

2000-05-28 * "Initialize account"
  Equity:Opening-Balances                    -1256.35 USD
  Assets:CA:BofA:Checking                     1256.35 USD

2014-07-01 balance Assets:CA:BofA:Checking    1256.35 USD
</code></pre>
<p>From here onwards, you would start adding entries reflecting everything
that happened after 7/1. However, what if you wanted to go <em>back</em> in
time? It is perfectly reasonable that once you’ve got your
chart-of-accounts set up you might want to fill in the missing history
until at least the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>Let’s assume you had a single transaction in June 2014, and let’s add
it:</p>
<pre><code>2000-05-28 open Assets:CA:BofA:Checking  USD

2000-05-28 * "Initialize account"
  Equity:Opening-Balances                    -1256.35 USD
  Assets:CA:BofA:Checking                     1256.35 USD

2014-06-28 * "Paid credit card bill"
  Assets:CA:BofA:Checking                     -700.00 USD
  Liabilities:US:Amex:Platinum                 700.00 USD

2014-07-01 balance Assets:CA:BofA:Checking    1256.35 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Now the balance assertion fails! You would need to adjust the
initialization entry to fix this:</p>
<pre><code>2000-05-28 open Assets:CA:BofA:Checking  USD

2000-05-28 * "Initialize account"
  Equity:Opening-Balances                    -1956.35 USD
  Assets:CA:BofA:Checking                     1956.35 USD

2014-06-28 * "Paid credit card bill"
  Assets:CA:BofA:Checking                     -700.00 USD
  Liabilities:US:Amex:Platinum                 700.00 USD

2014-07-01 balance Assets:CA:BofA:Checking    1256.35 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Now this works. So basically, every single time you insert an entry in
the past, you would have to adjust the balance. Isn’t this annoying?
Well, yes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can provide some help: you can use a Pad directive to
replace and automatically synthesize the balance adjustment to match the
next balance check, like this:</p>
<pre><code>2000-05-28 open Assets:CA:BofA:Checking  USD

2000-05-28 pad Assets:CA:BofA:Checking Equity:Opening-Balances

2014-06-28 * "Paid credit card bill"
  Assets:CA:BofA:Checking                     -700.00 USD
  Liabilities:US:Amex:Platinum                 700.00 USD

2014-07-01 balance Assets:CA:BofA:Checking    1256.35 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is only needed for balance sheet accounts (Assets and
Liabilities) because we don’t care about the initial balances of the
Income and Expenses accounts, we only care about their transitional
value (the changes they post during a period). For example, it makes no
sense to bring up the Expenses:Restaurant account to the sum total value
of all the costs of the meals you consumed since you were born.</p>
<p>So you will probably want to get started with Open &amp; Pad directives for
each Assets and Liabilities accounts.</p>

<p>Some people have suggested that Beancount automatically detect
duplicated transactions based on a heuristic and automatically
ignore (remove) one of the two, but this has not been tried out yet.
In particular, this would lend itself well to organizing
transactions not just per section, but in separate files, i.e., all
files would contain all the transactions for the accounts they
represent. If you’re interested in adding this feature, you could
easily implement this as a plugin, without disrupting the rest of
the system.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
