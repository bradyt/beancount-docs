<p><em>This document explains how we accumulate commodities and<br />
match sales (reductions) against accumulated inventory contents.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Beyond the ability to track and list the postings made to each of the
accounts (an operation that produces a <em>journal</em> of entries), one of the
most common and useful operations of Beancount is to sum up the
positions of arbitrary sets of postings. These aggregations are at the
heart of how Beancount works, and are implemented in an object called
“inventory.” This document explains how this aggregation process works.
If you’re going to track investments, it’s necessary to understand what
follows.</p>
<h2 id="matches-booking-methods">Matches &amp; Booking Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#matches-booking-methods" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In order to get the big picture, let’s walk through the various booking
features by way of a simple examples. This should expose you to all the
main ideas in one go.</p>
<h3 id="simple-postings-no-cost">Simple Postings — No Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#simple-postings-no-cost" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Consider a set of simple postings to an account, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code>2016-04-24 * "Deposit check"
  Assets:Bank:Checking      221.23 USD
  …

2016-04-29 * "ATM Withdrawal"
  Assets:Bank:Checking     -100.00 USD
  …

2016-04-29 * "Debit card payment"
  Assets:Bank:Checking      -45.67 USD
  …
</code></pre>
<p>The inventory of the Checking account begins empty. After the first
transaction, its contents are 221.23 USD. After the second, 121.23 USD.
Finally, the third transaction brings this balance to 75.56 USD. This
seems very natural; the numbers simply add to.</p>
<p>It might be obvious, but note also that the numbers are allowed to
change the sign (go negative).</p>
<h3 id="multiple-commodities">Multiple Commodities<a class="headerlink" href="#multiple-commodities" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>An inventory may contain more than one type of commodity. It is
equivalent to a mapping from commodity to some number of units. For
example,</p>
<pre><code>2016-07-24 * "Dinner before leaving NYC"
  Expenses:Restaurants     34.58 USD
  …

2016-07-26 * "Food with friends after landing"
  Expenses:Restaurants     62.11 CAD
  …
</code></pre>
<p>After those two transactions, the Restaurants account contains 34.58 USD
and 62.11 CAD. Its contents are said to be of mixed commodities. And
naturally, postings are applied to just the currencies they affect. For
instance, the following transaction</p>
<pre><code>2016-07-27 * "Brunch"
  Expenses:Restaurants     23.91 CAD
  …
</code></pre>
<p>brings the balance of that account to 34.58 USD and 86.02 CAD. The
number of units USD hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>Note that accounts may contain any number of commodities, and this is
also true for commodities held at cost, which we’ll see shortly. While
this is made possible, I recommend that you define enough accounts to
keep a single commodity in each; this can be enforced with the “<a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/default/beancount/plugins/onecommodity.py"><span
class="underline">onecommodity</span></a>”
plugin.</p>
<h3 id="cost-basis">Cost Basis<a class="headerlink" href="#cost-basis" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Things get a little more hairy when we consider the tracking of
investments with a cost basis. Beancount allows you to associate a cost
basis and an optional label with a particular lot acquired. Consider
these two purchases to an investment account:</p>
<pre><code>2015-04-01 * "Buy some shares of Hooli in April"
  Assets:Invest            25 HOOL {23.00 USD, "first-lot"}
  …

2015-05-01 * "Buy some more shares of Hooli in May"
  Assets:Invest            35 HOOL {27.00 USD}
  …
</code></pre>
<p>So now, the investment account’s inventory contains</p>
<pre><code>          units ccy   cost  cost-ccy lot-date    label
             25 HOOL {23.00 USD,     2015-04-01, "first-lot"}
             35 HOOL {27.00 USD,     2015-05-01, None}
</code></pre>
<p>Those two lots were not merged, they are still two distinct positions in
the inventory. Inventories merge lots together and adjust the units only
if the commodity and <em>all</em> of its cost attributes exactly match. (In
practice, it’s pretty rare that two augmentations will have the same
cost and date attributes.)</p>
<p>Note how Beancount automatically associated the acquisition date to each
lot; you can override it if desired, by adding the date similar to the
optional label. this is useful for making cost basis adjustments).</p>
<p>Postings that <em>add</em> to the content of an inventory are called
<strong>augmentations</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="reductions">Reductions<a class="headerlink" href="#reductions" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>But how do we remove commodities from an inventory?</p>
<p>You could eat away at an existing lot by selling some of it. You do this
by posting a <strong>reduction</strong> to the account, like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell some shares"
  Assets:Invest           -12 HOOL {23.00 USD}
  …
</code></pre>
<p>Just to be clear, what makes this posting a <strong>reduction</strong> is the mere
fact that the sign (-) is opposite that of the balance of the account
(+25) for that commodity. This posting tells Beancount to find all lots
with a cost basis of 23.00 USD and remove 12 units from it. The
resulting inventory will be</p>
<pre><code>          units ccy   cost  cost-ccy lot-date    label
             13 HOOL {23.00 USD,     2015-04-01, "first-lot"}
             35 HOOL {27.00 USD,     2015-05-01, None}
</code></pre>
<p>Note how the first posting was reduced by 12 units. We didn’t have to
specify all of the lot’s attributes, just the cost. We could have
equivalently used the date to specify which lot to reduce:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell some shares"
  Assets:Invest           -12 HOOL {2015-04-01}
  …
</code></pre>
<p>Or the label:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell some shares"
  Assets:Invest           -12 HOOL {"first-lot"}
  …
</code></pre>
<p>Or a combination of these. Any combination of attributes will be matched
against the inventory contents to find which lot to reduce. In fact, if
the inventory happened to have just a single lot in it, you could reduce
it like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell some shares"
  Assets:Invest           -12 HOOL {}
  …
</code></pre>
<h3 id="ambiguous-matches">Ambiguous Matches<a class="headerlink" href="#ambiguous-matches" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>But what happens if multiple lots match the reduction? For example, with
the previous inventory containing two lots, if you wrote your sale like
this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell some shares"
  Assets:Invest           -12 HOOL {}
  …
</code></pre>
<p>Beancount wouldn’t be able to figure out which lot needs to get reduced.
We have an ambiguous match.</p>
<p>Partially ambiguous matches are also possible. For example, if you have
the following inventory to reduce from:</p>
<pre><code>          units ccy   cost  cost-ccy lot-date    label
             25 HOOL {23.00 USD,     2015-04-01, None}
             30 HOOL {25.00 USD,     2015-04-01, None}
             35 HOOL {27.00 USD,     2015-05-01, None}
</code></pre>
<p>And you attempted to reduce like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell some shares"
  Assets:Invest           -12 HOOL {2015-04-01}
  …
</code></pre>
<p>The first two lots are selected as matches.</p>
<h3 id="strict-booking">Strict Booking<a class="headerlink" href="#strict-booking" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>What does Beancount do with ambiguous matches? By default, it issues an
error.</p>
<p>More precisely, what happens is that Beancount invokes the <strong>booking
method</strong> and it handles the ambiguous match depending on what it is set.
The default booking method is “<strong>STRICT</strong>” and it just gives up and
spits out an error, telling you you need to refine your input in order
to disambiguate your inventory reduction.</p>
<h3 id="fifo-and-lifo-booking">FIFO and LIFO Booking<a class="headerlink" href="#fifo-and-lifo-booking" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Other booking methods are available. They can be configured using
options, like this:</p>
<pre><code>option "booking_method" "FIFO"
</code></pre>
<p>The “<strong>FIFO</strong>” method automatically select the oldest of the matching
lots up to the requested size of the reduction. For example, given our
previous inventory:</p>
<pre><code>          units ccy   cost  cost-ccy lot-date    label
             25 HOOL {23.00 USD,     2015-04-01, "first-lot"}
             35 HOOL {27.00 USD,     2015-05-01, None}
</code></pre>
<p>Attempting to reduce 28 shares like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell some shares"
  Assets:Invest           -28 HOOL {}
  …
</code></pre>
<p>would match both lots, completely reduce the first one to zero units and
remove the remaining 3 units from the second lot, to result in the
following inventory:</p>
<pre><code>          units ccy   cost  cost-ccy lot-date    label
             32 HOOL {27.00 USD,     2015-05-01, None}
</code></pre>
<p>The “LIFO” method works similarly, but consumes the youngest (latest)
lots first, working its way backward in time to remove the volume.</p>
<h3 id="per-account-booking-method">Per-account Booking Method<a class="headerlink" href="#per-account-booking-method" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>You don’t have to make all accounts follow the same booking method; the
option in the previous section sets the default method for all accounts.
In order to override the booking method for a particular account, you
can use an optional string option on the account’s Open directive, like
this:</p>
<pre><code>2014-01-01 open Assets:Invest    "FIFO"
</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to treat different accounts with a different booking
resolution.</p>
<h3 id="total-matches">Total Matches<a class="headerlink" href="#total-matches" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There is an exception to strict booking: if the entire inventory is
being reduced by exactly the total number of units, it’s clear that all
the matching lots are to be selected and this is considered unambiguous,
even under “STRICT” booking. For example, under “STRICT” booking, this
reduction would empty up the previous inventory without raising an
error, because there are 25 + 35 shares matching:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell all my shares"
  Assets:Invest           -60 HOOL {}
  …
</code></pre>
<h3 id="average-booking">Average Booking<a class="headerlink" href="#average-booking" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Retirement accounts created by government incentive programs (such as
the 401k plan in the US or the RRSP in Canada) typically consist in
pre-tax money. For these types of accounts, brokers usually disregard
the calculation of cost basis because the taxation is to be made upon
distributing money outside the account. These accounts are often managed
to the extent that they are fully invested; therefore, fees are often
taken as shares of the investment portfolio, priced on the day the fee
is paid out. This makes it awkward to track the cost basis of individual
lots.</p>
<p>The correct way to deal with this is to treat the number of units and
the cost basis of each commodity’s entire set of lots separately. For
example, the following two transactions:</p>
<pre><code>2016-07-28 * "Buy some shares of retirement fund"
  Assets:Invest       45.0045 VBMPX {11.11 USD}
  …

2016-10-12 * "Buy some shares of retirement fund"
  Assets:Invest       54.5951 VBMPX {10.99 USD}
  …
</code></pre>
<p>Should result in a single lot with the total number of units and the
averaged cost:</p>
<pre><code>          units ccy    cost    cost-ccy lot-date    label
        99.5996 VBMPX {11.0442 USD,     2016-07-28, None}
</code></pre>
<p>A fee taken in this account might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2016-12-30 * "Quarterly management fee"
  Assets:Invest       -1.4154 VBMPX {10.59 USD}
  Expenses:Fees
</code></pre>
<p>Even with negative units the number and cost get aggregated separately:</p>
<pre><code>          units ccy    cost    cost-ccy lot-date    label
        98.1842 VBMPX {11.0508 USD,     2016-07-28, None}
</code></pre>

</tbody>
</table>

<h3 id="no-booking">No Booking<a class="headerlink" href="#no-booking" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>However, there is another way to deal with non-taxable accounts in the
meantime: you can simply disable the booking. There is a booking method
called “<strong>NONE</strong>” which implements a very liberal strategy which accepts
any new lot.. New lots are always appended unconditionally to the
inventory. Using this strategy on the transactions from the previous
section would result in this inventory:</p>
<pre><code>          units ccy    cost  cost-ccy lot-date    label
        45.0045 VBMPX {11.11 USD,     2016-07-28, None}
        54.5951 VBMPX {10.99 USD,     2016-10-12, None}
        -1.4154 VBMPX {10.59 USD,     2016-12-30, None}
</code></pre>
<p>Observe how the resulting inventory has a mix of signs; normally this is
not allowed, but it is tolerated under this degenerate booking method.
Note that under this method, the only meaningful values are the <em>total</em>
number of units and the <em>total</em> or <em>average</em> cost amounts. The
individual lots aren’t really lots, they only represent the list of all
postings made to that account.</p>
<p>Note: If you are familiar with Ledger, this is the default and only
booking method that it supports.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#summary" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In summary, here’s what we presented in the walkthrough. <em>Augmentations</em>
are never problematic; they always add a new position to an existing
inventory. On the other hand, <em>reductions</em> may result in a few outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Single match.</strong> Only one position matches the reduction; it is
    reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Total match.</strong> The total number of units requested matches the
    total number of units of the positions matched. These positions are
    reduced away.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No match.</strong> None of the positions matches the reducing posting. An
    error is raised.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li><strong>Ambiguous matches.</strong> More than one position in the inventory
    matches the reducing posting; <em>the booking method is invoked to
    handle this</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few booking methods available to handle the last case:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>STRICT.</strong> An error is raised.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FIFO.</strong> Units from oldest (earliest) lots are selected until the
    reduction is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>LIFO.</strong> Units from youngest (latest) lots are selected until the
    reduction is complete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AVERAGE.</strong> After every reduction, all the units of the affected
    commodity are merged and their new average cost is recalculated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NONE.</strong> Booking is disabled; the reducing lots is simply added to
    the inventory. This results in an inventory with mixed signs and
    only the total number of units and total cost basis are sensible
    numbers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beancount has a default booking method for all accounts, which can be
overridden with an option:</p>
<pre><code>option "booking_method" "FIFO"
</code></pre>
<p>The default value for the booking method is “STRICT”. I recommend that
you leave it that way and override the booking method for specific
accounts.</p>
<p>The method can be specified for each account by adding a string to its
Open directive:</p>
<pre><code>2016-05-01 open Assets:Vanguard:RGAGX  "AVERAGE"
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-prices-are-used">How Prices are Used<a class="headerlink" href="#how-prices-are-used" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The short answer is that prices aren’t used nor affect the booking
algorithm at all. However, it is relevant to discuss what they do in
this context because users invariably get confused about their
interpretation.</p>
<p>There are two use cases for prices: making conversions between
commodities and tagging a reducing lot with its sale price in order to
record it and optionally balance the proceeds.</p>
<h3 id="commodity-conversions">Commodity Conversions<a class="headerlink" href="#commodity-conversions" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Conversions are used to exchange one currency for another. They look
like this:</p>
<pre><code>2016-04-24 * "Deposit check"
  Assets:Bank:Checking      220.00 USD @ 1.3 CAD
  Income:Payment           -286.00 CAD
</code></pre>
<p>For the purpose of booking it against the Checking account’s inventory,
the posting with the price attached to it is treated just the same as if
there was no price: the Checking account simply receives a deposit of
220.00 units of USD and will match against positions of commodity “USD”.
The price is used only to verify that the transaction balances and
ensure the double-entry accounting rule is respected (220.00 x 1.3 CAD +
-286.00 CAD = 0.00). It is otherwise ignored for the purpose of
modifying the inventory contents. In a sense, after the postings have
been applied to the account inventories, the price is forgotten and the
inventory balance retains no memory of the deposit having occurred from
a conversion.</p>
<h3 id="price-vs-cost-basis">Price vs. Cost Basis<a class="headerlink" href="#price-vs-cost-basis" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>One might wonder how the price is used if there is a cost basis
specification, like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell some shares"
  Assets:Invest:HOOL           -12 HOOL {23.00 USD} @ 24.70 USD
  Assets:Invest:Cash        296.40 USD
  Income:Invest:Gains
</code></pre>
<p>The answer is often surprising to many users: the price is <strong>not used</strong>
by the balancing algorithm if there is a cost basis; the cost basis is
the number used to balance the postings. This is a useful property that
allows us to compute capital gains automatically. In the previous
example, the balance algorithm would sum up -12 x 23.00 + 296.40 =
-20.40 USD, which is the capital gain, (24.70 - 23.00) * 12. It would
complete the last posting and assign it this value.</p>
<p>In general, the way that profits on sales are calculated is by weighing
the proceedings, i.e., the cash deposits, against the cost basis of the
sold lots, and this is sufficient to establish the gain difference.
Also, if an <em>augmenting</em> posting happens to have a price annotation on
it, it is also unused.</p>
<p>The price is an annotation for your records. It remains attached to the
Posting objects and if you want to make use of it somehow, you can
always do that by writing some Python code. There are already two
plugins which make use of this annotation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/tip/src/python/beancount/plugins/implicit_prices.py"><strong><span
    class="underline">beancount.plugins.implicit_prices</span></strong></a>:
    This plugin takes the prices attached to the postings and
    automatically creates and inserts Price directives for each of them,
    in order to feed the global price database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/tip/src/python/beancount/plugins/sellgains.py"><strong><span
    class="underline">beancount.plugins.sellgains</span></strong></a>:
    This plugin implements an additional balancing check: it uses the
    prices to compute the expected proceeds and weighs them against all
    the other postings of the transaction <em>excluding</em> any postings to
    Income accounts. In our example, it would check that (-12 x 24.70 +
    296.40) = 0. This provides yet another means of verifying the
    correctness of your input.</p>

<h2 id="trades">Trades<a class="headerlink" href="#trades" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The combination of acquiring some asset and selling it back is what we
call a “trade.” In Beancount we consider only assets with a cost basis
to be the subject of trades. Since booking reductions against
accumulated inventory contents happens during the booking process, this
is where trades should be identified and recorded.</p>

<p>The way trades will be implemented is by allowing the booking process to
insert matching metadata with unique UUIDs on both the augmenting and
reducing postings, in the stream of transactions. Functions and reports
will be provided that are able to easily extract the pairs of postings
for each reducing postings and filter those out in different ways.
Ultimately, one should be able to extract a list of all trades to a
table, with the acquisition and sale price, as well as other fees.</p>

<p>If you’re experiencing difficulties in recording your sales due to the
matching process, there are tools you can use to view an account’s
detailed inventory contents before and after applying a Transaction to
it. To do this, you can use the bean-doctor command. You invoke the
program providing it with the file and line number close to the
Transaction you want to select, like this:</p>
<pre><code>bean-doctor context &lt;filename&gt; &lt;line-no&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The resulting output will show the list of inventory contents of all
affected accounts prior to the transaction being applied, including cost
basis, acquisition date, and optional label fully rendered. Note that
some failures are typically handled by throwing away a invalid
Transaction’s effects (but never quietly).</p>
<p>From Emacs or VI, placing the cursor near a transaction and invoking the
corresponding command is the easiest way to invoke the command, as it
inserts the line number automatically.</p>

<h3 id="data-representation">Data Representation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-representation" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>It is useful to know how positions are represented in an inventory
object. A <em>Position</em> is essentially some number of units of a commodity
with some optional information about its acquisition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost.</strong> Its per-unit acquisition cost (the “cost basis”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Date.</strong> The date at which the units were acquired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Label.</strong> Some user-specified label which can be used to refer to
    the lot).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We often refer to these position objects as “lots” or “legs.”
Schematically, a position object looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/11_how_inventories_work/media/53be27dbd44584c32fec4dc94642a67e83d2023d.png" style="width:3.76389in;height:3.75in" /></p>
<p>The structure of a <em>Position</em> object.</p>
<p>There are two different types of positions, discussed in detail in the
sections that follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Simple positions.</strong> These are positions with no cost basis. The
    “cost” attribute is set to a null value. (“None” in Python.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Positions held at cost.</strong> These are positions with an associated
    cost basis and acquisition details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An <em>Inventory</em> is simply an accumulation of such positions, represented
as a list. We sometimes talk of the <em>ante-inventory</em> to refer to the
contents of the inventory before a transaction’s postings have been
applied to it, and the <em>ex-inventory</em> to the resulting inventory after
they have been applied.</p>
<p>A <em>Posting</em> is an object which is a superset of a position: in addition
to units and cost, it has an associated account and an optional price
attributes. If present, the price has the same type as units. It
represents one of the legs of a transaction in the input. Postings imply
positions, and these positions are added to inventories. We can say that
a position is <em>posted</em> to an account.</p>

<h3 id="why-booking-is-not-simple">Why Booking is Not Simple<a class="headerlink" href="#why-booking-is-not-simple" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The complexity of the reduction process shows itself when we consider
how to keep track of the cost basis of various lots. To demonstrate how
this works, let us consider a simple example that we shall reuse in the
different sections below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>25 shares are bought on 4/1 at $23/share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>35 shares are bought on 5/1 at $27/share.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30 shares are sold on 5/15; at that time, the price is $26/share.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll ignore commissions for now, they don’t introduce any additional
complexity. In Beancount, this scenario would be recorded like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-04-01 * "Buy some shares of Hooli in April"
  Assets:Invest:HOOL            25 HOOL {23.00 USD}
  Assets:Invest:Cash       -575.00 USD

2015-05-01 * "Buy some more shares of Hooli in May"
  Assets:Invest:HOOL            35 HOOL {27.00 USD}
  Assets:Invest:Cash       -945.00 USD

2015-05-15 * "Sell 30 shares"
  Assets:Invest:HOOL           -30 HOOL {...} @ 26.00 USD
  Assets:Invest:Cash        780.00 USD
  Income:Invest:HOOL:Gains
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the entire question revolves around <em>which</em> of the shares are
selected to be sold. I’ve rendered this input as a red ellipsis (“…”).
Whatever the user puts in that spot will be used to determine which lot
we want to use.</p>
<p>Whichever lot(s) we elect to be the ones sold will determine the amount
of gains, because that is a function of the cost basis of those shares.
This is why this matters.</p>
<h3 id="augmentations-vs-reductions">Augmentations vs. Reductions<a class="headerlink" href="#augmentations-vs-reductions" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The most important observation is that there are two distinct kinds of
lot specifications which look very similar in the input but which are
processed very differently.</p>
<p>When we buy, as in the first transaction above, the {...} cost basis
syntax provides Beancount with information about a <em>new</em> lot:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-01 * "Buy some more shares of Hooli in May"
  Assets:Invest:HOOL            35 HOOL {27.00 USD}
  Assets:Invest:Cash       -945.00 USD
</code></pre>
<p>We call this an “augmentation” to the inventory, because it will simply
add a new position to it. The <strong>cost basis</strong> that you provide is
attached to this position and preserved through time, in the inventory.
In addition, there are a few other pieces of data you can provide for an
augmenting lot. Let’s have a look at all the data that can be provided
in the cost spec:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost basis.</strong> This consists in per-unit and total cost
    numbers—which are combined into a single per-unit number—and a
    currency.</li>
</ul>
<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Acquisition date.</strong> A lot has an acquisition date. By default, the
    date attached of its parent transaction will be set as its
    acquisition date automatically. You may override this date by
    providing one. This comes in handy to handle stock splits or wash
    sales and preserve the original acquisition date of the replacement
    shares, as we’ll see later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Label.</strong> You can provide a unique label for it, so that you can
    more easily refer to it later on, when you sell some or all of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Merge.</strong> An indicator (a flag) that the lot should be merged (this
    will be useful for average cost booking which will be implemented
    later).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For an <strong>augmenting postings</strong>, these informations must be either
provided or inferred automatically. They can be provided in any order:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-01 * "Buy some more shares of Hooli in May"
  Assets:Invest:HOOL            35 HOOL {2015-04-25, 27.00 USD, "hooli-123"}
  Assets:Invest:Cash       -945.00 USD
</code></pre>
<p>If you omit the date, the date of the Transaction is attached to it. If
you omit the cost, the rest of the postings must be filled in such that
the cost amount can be inferred from them. Since the label is optional
anyway, an unspecified label field is left as a null value.</p>
<p>You might wonder why it is allowed to override the date of an
augmentation; it is useful when making cost basis adjustments to
preserve the original acquisition date of a posting: You remove the
posting, and then replace it with its original date and a new cost
basis.</p>
<p>Now, when we sell those shares, we will refer to the posting as a
<strong>“reducing” posting</strong>, a “<strong>reduction</strong>”. Note that the terms
“augmenting” and “reducing” are just terminology I’m came up with in the
context of designing how Beancount processes inventories; they’re not
general accounting terms.</p>
<p>It’s a “reduction” because we’re removing shares from the inventory that
has been accumulated up to the date of its transaction. For example, if
we were to sell 30 shares from that lot of 35 shares, the input might
look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell 30 shares"
  Assets:Invest:HOOL           -30 HOOL {27.00 USD} @ 26.00 USD
  Assets:Invest:Cash        780.00 USD
  Income:Invest:HOOL:Gains
</code></pre>
<p>While the input looks the same as on the augmenting posting, Beancount
handles this quite differently: it looks at the state of the account’s
inventory before applying the transaction and finds all the positions
that match the lot data you provided. It then uses the details of the
matched lots as the cost basis information for the reducing posting.</p>
<p>In this example, it would simply match all the positions which have a
cost basis of $27.00. This example’s inventory before the sale contains
a single lot of 35 shares at $27.00, so there is a single position
matching it and that lot is reduced by 30 shares and 5 shares remain.
We’ll see later what happens in the case of multiple lots matching the
specification.</p>
<p>Note that you could have provide other subsets of lot information to
match against, like just providing the label, for example:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-15 * "Sell 30 shares"
  Assets:Invest:HOOL           -30 HOOL {"hooli-123"} @ 26.00 USD
  Assets:Invest:Cash        780.00 USD
  Income:Invest:HOOL:Gains
</code></pre>
<p>This is also a valid way to identify the particular lot you wish to
reduce. If you had provided a date here, it would also only be used to
match against the inventory contents, to disambiguate between lots
acquired at different dates, not to attach the date anywhere. And
furthermore, if there was a single lot in the inventory you could have
also just provided just an empty cost basis spec like this: “{}”. The
Booking Methods section below will delve into the detail of what happens
when the matches are ambiguous.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you’re adding something to an account’s inventory (augmenting),
    the information you provide is used to create a new lot and is
    attached to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you’re removing from an account’s inventory (reducing), the
    information you provide is used to filter the inventory contents to
    select which of the lot(s) to reduce, and information from the
    selected lots is filled in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="homogeneous-and-mixed-inventories">Homogeneous and Mixed Inventories<a class="headerlink" href="#homogeneous-and-mixed-inventories" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>So far in the example and in the vast majority of the examples in the
documentation, “augmenting” means adding a positive number of shares.
But in Beancount many of the accounts normally have a negative balance,
e.g., liabilities accounts. It’s fair to ask if it makes sense to hold a
negative balance of commodities held at cost.</p>
<p>The answer is yes. These would correspond to “short” positions. Most
people are unlikely to be selling short, but Beancount inventories
support it. How we define “augmenting” is in relation to the existing
balance of lots of a particular commodity. For example, if an account’s
inventory contains the following positions:</p>
<pre><code>                                25 HOOL {23.00 USD, 2016-04-01}
                                35 HOOL {27.00 USD, 2016-05-01}
</code></pre>
<p>Then “adding” means a positive number of shares. On the other hand, if
the account contains only short positions, like this:</p>
<pre><code>                               -20 HOOL {23.00 USD, 2016-04-15}
                               -10 HOOL {27.00 USD, 2016-05-15}
</code></pre>
<p>Then “adding” means a negative number of shares, and “reducing” would be
carried out by matching a positive number of shares against it.</p>
<p>The two inventories portrayed above are homogeneous in units of HOOL,
that is, all of the positions have the same sign. With of the most
booking methods we will see further, Beancount makes it impossible to
create a non-homogeneous, or “mixed,” inventory. But the “NONE” method
allows it. A mixed inventory might have the following contents, for
example:</p>
<pre><code>                                25 HOOL {23.00 USD, 2016-04-01}
                               -20 HOOL {23.00 USD, 2016-04-15}
</code></pre>
<p>As you may intuit, the notion of “augmenting” or “reducing” only makes
sense for homogeneous inventories.</p>
