<p>This document presents a method for precisely and easily accounting for
shared expenses in complicated group situations. For example, traveling
with a group of friends where people pay for different things. We show
it is possible to deal with expenses to be split evenly among the group
as well as group expenses that should be allocated to specific persons.</p>
<p>The method uses the double-entry accounting system. The essence of the
method consists in separating the accounting of expenses and their
associated payments. This makes it much easier to deal with shared
costs, because using this method it doesn’t matter who pays for what: we
reconcile the precise amounts owed for each individual at the end and
automatically compute final correcting transfers for each.</p>
<p>This article is structured around a simple trip with expenses shared
equally by two people. However, the same method generalizes to any type
of project with incomes and expenses to be shared among multiple
participants, and splitting expenses evenly or not.</p>

<p>Martin (the author) and Caroline (his girlfriend) visited Mexico in
March 2015. We visited the island of Cozumel for a SCUBA diving trip for
three days and then headed to Tulum for two days to relax and dive in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote"><span
class="underline">cenotes</span></a>.</p>
<p>Our assumptions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Chaotic payments</strong>. We lead very busy lives… both of us are going
    to make payments ahead of time and during the trip, without any
    forethought regarding who will pay for what, though we will
    carefully record every payment. Each of us just pays for whatever
    preparation costs as needed to arrange this trip. For example,
    Caroline selected and booked flights early while I paid for the
    resort and booked the rental and activities at the local dive shop
    one week before departure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use of shared and individual assets.</strong> Both of us are bringing
    cash, and are going to make payments during the trip from our
    respective wallets as well as from a shared pool of cash converted
    to local currency (Mexican pesos, for which I will use the “MXN”
    symbol), and we will use credit cards as necessary before and during
    the trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multiple currencies.</strong> Some of our expenses will be denominated in
    US dollars and some in Mexican pesos. For example, flights were paid
    in US dollars, local meals and the accommodation were paid in pesos,
    but the local dive shop charged us dollars. Converted amounts will
    come from both cash and credit cards sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Individual expenses in shared pool.</strong> While most of the expenses
    are to be shared equally, some of the expenses will apply to only
    one of us, and we want to account for those explicitly. For example,
    Caroline took a SCUBA certification course (<a href="http://www.padi.com/scuba-diving/padi-courses/course-catalog/open-water-diver/"><span
    class="underline">PADI Open
    Water</span></a>)
    and will pay for that on her own; similarly, she should not be
    paying for Martin’s expensive boat diving costs. To complicate
    matters, the dive shop issued us a single joint bill for everything
    at the end of our stay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-note-about-sharing"><a id="a-note-about-sharing"></a>A Note About Sharing<a class="headerlink" href="#a-note-about-sharing" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>I feel that something should be said about the “sharing” aspect of our
expenses, as this topic has come up on previous discussions on the
mailing-lists involving sharing examples.</p>
<p><strong>We are nitpicking on purpose.</strong> For the purpose of this exercise, we
are accounting for every little penny spent in an incredibly detailed
manner. The point of this document is specifically to show how a complex
set of transactions well accounted for can be efficiently and simply
disentangled to a precise accounting of expenses for each participant,
regardless of who actually makes the payments. We are not
cheapskates.<img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/4346d251f32f6dbd2a7738fd62b01710c74a1e2f.jpg" style="width:1.53715in;height:2.14063in" /></p>
<p><strong>We will assume that we’ve decided to split expenses evenly.</strong> Our
“generosity” to each other is not a topic relevant to this document.
We’re both well compensated working professionals and you can assume
that we’ve agreed to split the common costs for this trip evenly
(50/50).</p>
<p>One of the attributes of the method we show here is that the decision of
how we choose to split expenses can be made <em>separately</em> from the actual
payment of costs. For example, we may decide in the end that I pay for
⅔rd of the trip, but that can be decided precisely rather than in an
ad-hoc “oh, I think I remember I paid for this” manner. This is
especially useful in a larger group of people because when expenses
aren’t tracked accurately, usually <em><span
class="underline">everyone</span></em> is left with a feeling that they paid
more than the others. The sum of the <em>perceived</em> fractions of expenses
paid in a group is always greater than 100%...</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-the-method"><a id="overview-of-the-method"></a>Overview of the Method<a class="headerlink" href="#overview-of-the-method" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In this section we present a brief illustrated overview of the method. A
set of common Assets accounts that belong to the project, and book all
our individual expenses and transfer for the trip as coming from
external Income accounts:</p>
<p><img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/289330baa5c79e87573a00beb6f2833acb4422b2.png" style="width:3.94444in;height:2.08333in" /></p>
<p>During the trip, we use the common Assets to make expenses. Most of the
expenses are attributed to both of us (and to be shared eventually), but
some of the expenses are intended to be attributed to each of us
individually:</p>
<p><img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/6ef882be80d2737b1a9d5a539d83db18ed6f3629.png" style="width:3.94444in;height:2.23611in" /></p>
<p>After the trip, remaining Assets (like cash we walked home with) gets
distributed back to ourselves to zero out the balances of the Assets
accounts and we record this through contra postings to Income accounts:</p>
<p><img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/caf48cd3423e49909dd47cfcec7e23618b6543e0.png" style="width:3.90278in;height:2.94444in" /></p>
<p>Finally, the list of shared Expenses are split between each other—using
a plugin that forks every posting that is intended to be a shared
expense—and the final amount is used to make a final transfer between
each other so that we’ve each paid for our respective expenses and we’re
square:</p>
<p><img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/a8ef6b0ea3068f0799045e923c603b8aa77b1cc2.png" style="width:4.86111in;height:1.97222in" /></p>
<p>Note that the final balance of expenses for each participant may differ,
and these are due to particular expenses that were attributed
separately, or if we decide to split the total unevenly.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-track-expenses"><a id="how-to-track-expenses"></a>How to Track Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-track-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In order to write down all expenses for this trip we will open a brand
new Beancount input file. Despite the fact that the expenses will come
from each person’s personal accounts, it is useful to think of the trip
as a special project, as if it were a separate entity, e.g., a company
that exists only for the duration of the trip. The example file we wrote
for our trip <a href="http://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/tip/examples/sharing/cozumel2015.beancount"><span class="underline">can be found
here</span></a>
and should help you follow along this text.</p>
<h3 id="accounts"><a id="accounts"></a>Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The set of accounts in the input file should not have to match your
personal Beancount file’s account names. The accounts we will use
include accounts that correspond to Martin and Caroline’s personal
accounts but with generic names (e.g., Income:Martin:CreditCard instead
of Liabilities:US:Chase), and expense accounts may not match any regular
expenses in my personal Beancount file—it’s not important.</p>
<p>As a convention, any account that pertains specifically to one of the
travelers will <strong>include that person’s name</strong> in the account name. For
example, Caroline’s credit card will be named
“Income:<strong>Caroline</strong>:CreditCard”. This is important, as we will use this
later on to split contributions and expenses.</p>
<p>Let’s examine the different types of accounts we will need to carry this
out.</p>
<h4 id="external-income-accounts"><a id="external-income-accounts"></a>External Income Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#external-income-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>The “project” will receive income in the form of transfers from personal
accounts of either traveler. These are accounts we will consider
external to the project and so will define them as Income accounts:</p>
<pre><code>;; External accounts for Martin.
2015-02-01 open Income:Martin:Cash
2015-02-01 open Income:Martin:Cash:Foreign
2015-02-01 open Income:Martin:Wallet
2015-02-01 open Income:Martin:CreditCard

;; External accounts for Caroline.
2015-02-01 open Income:Caroline:Cash
2015-02-01 open Income:Caroline:Wallet
2015-02-01 open Income:Caroline:MetroCard
2015-02-01 open Income:Caroline:CreditCard
</code></pre>
<p>Transactions carried out from these accounts must be copied from your
personal Beancount file. Obviously, you must be careful to include all
the transactions pertaining to the trip. I used a tag to do this in my
personal file.</p>
<h4 id="assets-liabilities-accounts"><a id="assets-liabilities-accounts"></a>Assets &amp; Liabilities Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#assets-liabilities-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>There will have a few Asset accounts that will be active and exist for
the duration of the trip. These temporary accounts will be zero’ed out
at the end of it. One example is a pool of petty cash in local currency:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-01 open Assets:Cash:Pesos
  description: "A shared account to contain our pocket of pesos"
</code></pre>
<p>We also carried cash in each of our pockets while traveling, so I
created two separate accounts for that:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-01 open Assets:Cash:Martin
  description: "Cash for the trip held by Martin"

2015-02-01 open Assets:Cash:Caroline
  description: "Cash for the trip held by Caroline"
</code></pre>

<p>We will define various accounts to book our Expenses to. For example,
“Expenses:Flights” will contains our costs associated with flight
travel. For convenience, and because there are many types of expenses in
this file, we chose to leverage the “auto-accounts” plugin and let
Beancount automatically open these accounts:</p>
<pre><code>plugin "beancount.ops.auto_accounts"
</code></pre>
<p>The great majority of these accounts are for shared expenses to be split
between us. For example, shared SCUBA diving expenses will be booked to
“Expenses:Scuba”.</p>
<p>However, for expenses that are intended to be covered by one of us only,
we simply include the name of the traveler in the account name. For
example, Martin’s extra costs for boat diving will be booked to the
“Expenses:Scuba:Martin” account.</p>

<p>Let’s turn our attention to the different types of transactions present
in the file. In this section I will walk you through some representative
transactions (the names I give to these is arbitrary).</p>
<h4 id="contributing-transactions"><a id="contributing-transactions"></a>Contributing Transactions<a class="headerlink" href="#contributing-transactions" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Contributions to the project’s costs are usually done in the form of
expenses paid from external accounts. For example, Caroline paying for
flights with her credit card looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-01 * "Flights to Cancun"
   Income:Caroline:CreditCard        -976.00 USD
   Expenses:Flights
</code></pre>
<p>Martin paying for the taxi to the airport looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-25 * "Taxi to airport" ^433f66ea0e4e
  Expenses:Transport:Taxi                   62.80 USD
  Income:Martin:CreditCard
</code></pre>
<h4 id="bringing-cash"><a id="bringing-cash"></a>Bringing Cash<a class="headerlink" href="#bringing-cash" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>We both brought some cash on us, as we were warned it might be difficult
to use credit cards in Mexico. In my personal Beancount file, the cash
account is “Assets:Cash” but here it must get booked as an external
contribution with my name on it:</p>
<pre><code>;; Initial cash on us.
2015-02-24 * "Getting cash for travel"
  Income:Martin:Cash                        -1200 USD
  Assets:Cash:Martin                         1200 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Caroline’s cash is similar:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-24 * "Getting cash for travel"
  Income:Caroline:Cash                       -300 USD
  Assets:Cash:Caroline                        300 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, note that the Assets:Cash:Martin and Assets:Cash:Caroline
accounts are considered a part of the project, in this case it just
refers to who is carrying it. (These accounts are cleared at the end, so
it does not matter that our names are in them.)</p>
<h4 id="transfers"><a id="transfers"></a>Transfers<a class="headerlink" href="#transfers" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Before the trip, I was really busy. It looked like Caroline was going to
make most of arrangements and upfront payments, so I made a transfer to
her Google Wallet to help her cover for some expenses ahead of time:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-01 * "Transfer Martin -&gt; Caroline on Google Wallet"
  Income:Martin:Wallet                      -1000 USD
  Income:Caroline:Wallet                     1000 USD
</code></pre>
<h4 id="cash-conversions"><a id="cash-conversions"></a>Cash Conversions<a class="headerlink" href="#cash-conversions" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Obtaining local currency was done by changing a small amount of cash at
the airport (at a very bad rate):</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-25 * "Exchanged cash at XIC at CUN airport"
  Assets:Cash:Caroline                    -100.00 USD @ 12.00 MXN
  Assets:Cash:Pesos                          1200 MXN
</code></pre>
<p>The “Assets:Cash:Pesos” account tracks our common pool of local currency
that we use for various small expenses.</p>
<h4 id="cash-expenses-in-us-dollars"><a id="cash-expenses-in-us-dollars"></a>Cash Expenses in US Dollars<a class="headerlink" href="#cash-expenses-in-us-dollars" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Some local expenses will call for US money, which in this example I paid
from my cash pocket:</p>
<pre><code>2015-03-01 * "Motmot Diving" | "Deposit for cenote diving"
  Expenses:Scuba                            50.00 USD
  Assets:Cash:Martin
</code></pre>
<h4 id="cash-expenses-in-local-currency"><a id="cash-expenses-in-local-currency"></a>Cash Expenses in Local Currency<img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/6c5e7a3ecdb57f82345ca38ad79cee393ec1fdba.jpg" style="width:1.55003in;height:1.63021in" /><a class="headerlink" href="#cash-expenses-in-local-currency" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Paying cash using pesos from our shared stash of pesos looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-25 * "UltraMar Ferry across to Cozumel"
  Expenses:Transport:Bus                326 MXN
  Assets:Cash:Pesos
</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes we even had to pay with a mix of US dollars and pesos. In this
example, we ran out of pesos, so we have to give them dollars and pesos
(all the restaurants and hotels in the beach part of Tulum accept US
currency):</p>
<pre><code>2015-03-01 * "Hartwood" | "Dinner - ran out of pesos"
  Expenses:Restaurant                  1880 MXN
  Assets:Cash:Pesos                   -1400 MXN
  Assets:Cash:Martin                 -40.00 USD @ 12.00 MXN
</code></pre>
<h4 id="i-used-the-unfavorable-rate-the-restaurant-was-offering-to-accept-dollars-at-the-market-rate-was-145-at-the-time"><a id="i-used-the-unfavorable-rate-the-restaurant-was-offering-to-accept-dollars-at-the-market-rate-was-14.5-at-the-time."></a>I used the unfavorable rate the restaurant was offering to accept dollars at (the market rate was 14.5 at the time).<a class="headerlink" href="#i-used-the-unfavorable-rate-the-restaurant-was-offering-to-accept-dollars-at-the-market-rate-was-145-at-the-time" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<h4 id="individual-expenses"><a id="individual-expenses"></a>Individual Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#individual-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Here is an example of booking individual expenses using shared money. In
order for us have access to the reef for diving, we had to pay a “marine
park” fee of $2.50 per day to the island. This was a short trip where I
dove only three days there and Caroline’s fee was included in her course
except for one
day:<img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/e0cef7785d12af297926017d805ccad2efc51dbd.jpg" style="width:1.44375in;height:1.92188in" /></p>
<pre><code>  2015-02-25 * "Marine Park (3 days Martin, 1 day Caroline)"
    Expenses:Scuba:ParkFees:Martin             7.50 USD
    Expenses:Scuba:ParkFees:Caroline           2.50 USD
    Assets:Cash:Martin
</code></pre>
<p>All that needs to be done is to book these to expense accounts with our
names in them, which will get separated out at the end.</p>
<p>Here is a more complicated example: the dive shop at Scuba Club Cozumel
charged us a single bill at the end of our stay for all our rental gear
and extra dives. All I did here was translate the itemized bill into a
single transaction, booking to each other:</p>
<pre><code>2015-03-01 * "Scuba Club Cozumel" | "Dive shop bill" ^69b409189b37
  Income:Martin:CreditCard           -381.64 USD

<h4 id="final-balances"><a id="final-balances"></a>Final Balances<a class="headerlink" href="#final-balances" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>Of course you can use balance assertions at any time during the trip.
For example, just before leaving at the Cancun airport we knew we
wouldn’t spend any more Mexican pesos for a while, so I counted what we
had left after Caroline decided to splurge the remainder of them into
overpriced chocolate sold at the airport shop:</p>
<pre><code>2015-03-04 balance Assets:Cash:Pesos               65 MXN
</code></pre>
<p>Ideally the bookkeeper should want to do this at a quiet moment at the
end of every day or couple of days, which makes it easier to triangulate
an expense you might have forgotten to enter (we are on vacation after
all, in our relaxed state of mind we forget to write down stuff here and
there).</p>
<h4 id="clearing-asset-accounts"><a id="clearing-asset-accounts"></a>Clearing Asset Accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#clearing-asset-accounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h4>
<p>At the end of the trip, you should clear the final balances of all
Assets and Liabilities accounts by transferring the remaining funds out
to the participants, i.e., to the Income accounts. This should leave all
the balances of the trip at zero and ensures all the cash put forward
for trip expenses has been moved out to travelers.</p>
<p>By the way, it doesn’t matter much who keeps this money, because at the
end we will end up making a single correcting transfer that should
account for the balance required to create an even split. You can
transfer it to anyone; the end result will be the same.</p>
<p>Our clearing transaction looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-03-06 * "Final transfer to clear internal balances to external ones"
  Assets:Cash:Pesos                               -65 MXN
  Income:Martin:Cash:Foreign                       60 MXN
  Income:Caroline:Cash                              5 MXN
  Assets:Cash:Martin                             -330 USD
  Income:Martin:Cash                              330 USD
  Assets:Cash:Caroline                           -140 USD
  Income:Caroline:Cash                            140 USD

2015-03-07 balance Assets:Cash:Pesos                0 MXN
2015-03-07 balance Assets:Cash:Pesos                0 USD
2015-03-07 balance Assets:Cash:Martin               0 USD
2015-03-07 balance Assets:Cash:Caroline             0 USD
</code></pre>
<p>We had three 20 peso bills, and I kept the bills for future travels.
Caroline kept the 5 peso coin (forgot to hand it over as tip). We
transferred out the respective cash amounts we had been carrying
together during the trip.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-take-notes"><a id="how-to-take-notes"></a>How to Take Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-take-notes" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>During this trip I did not carry a laptop—this was vacation after all. I
like to disconnect. I did not carry a notebook either. Instead, I just
took notes at the end of the day on a few sheets of paper at the hotel.
This process took about 5-10 minutes each night, just recalling from
memory and writing things down.</p>
<p>These notes look like this:</p>
<p><img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/1a614f1e796245370dd17906a9115eca79d78756.png" alt="sharing-example-note-taking.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.68056in" /></p>
<p>I made a paper spreadsheet where each line had</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The narration for the transaction (a description that would allow me
    to select an Expenses account later on)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who paid (which Assets or Income account the money came from)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount (either in USD or MXN)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After our trip, I sat down at the computer and typed <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbitbucket.org%2Fblais%2Fbeancount%2Fsrc%2Ftip%2Fexamples%2Fsharing%2Fcozumel2015.beancount&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEPaKdOQ8UzCsGwRksl6sbCp6J2ZA"><span
class="underline">the corresponding Beancount
file</span></a>.
If I had a computer during my vacation I probably would have typed it as
we went along. Of course, I had to do a few adjustments here and there
because of mistakes.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: if you’re organized well, the overhead of doing this
is minimal.</p>
<h2 id="reconciling-expenses"><a id="reconciling-expenses"></a>Reconciling Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#reconciling-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Running bean-web on the trip’s file:</p>
<pre><code>bean-web beancount/examples/sharing/cozumel2015.beancount
</code></pre>
<p>You can view the balances in the “All Transactions” view (click on “All
Transactions”).</p>
<p>The Balance Sheet should show empty balances for Assets accounts:</p>
<p><img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/2a9a41808ed0e2b5fec809a5fde47f4e205646b5.png" alt="balsheet.png" style="width:6.28646in;height:2.57906in" /></p>
<p>The balances of the equity accounts should reflect the total amount of
currency conversions made during the trip. You can verify this by
calculating the amount-weight average rate like this: 7539.00 / 559.88
~= 13.465 USD/MXN (which is about right).</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-contributions"><a id="reviewing-contributions"></a>Reviewing Contributions<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-contributions" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The Income Statement should show a summary of all expenses and
contributions to the project:</p>
<p><img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/a8d4c5e20494c749682470c47ba891cc1e32d47f.png" alt="income.png" style="width:6.41468in;height:4.30729in" /></p>
<p>The Income account balances show the total amounts of contributions for
each person. Note that in creating the Income accounts, I went through
the extra step of creating some specific accounts for each source of
payment, like “Caroline’s Credit Card”, etc.</p>
<p>From this view, we can see that we contributed a total of 4254.28 USD
(and were left with 65 MXN in hand) for this trip. The expenses side
should match, considering the currency exchanges: 3694.40 + 7474 /
13.465 ~= 4249 USD which is approximately right (the small difference
can be explained by the varying currency conversions).</p>
<p>If you want to view the list of contribution payments and the final
balance, click on a particular traveler’s root account, e.g.,
“Income:Caroline” (click on “Caroline”) which should take you to the
Journal for that root account:</p>
<p><img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/9954279c84e3e4f951c125bffc0550f09bb82bc0.png" alt="caroline.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.63889in" /></p>
<p>This journal includes all the transactions in its sub-accounts. The
final value at the bottom should show the total balance of those
accounts, and thus, the amount of money Caroline contributed to this
trip: 415 USD, and kept 5 MXN (in coin). We can do the same for Martin
and find the final balance of 3839.28 USD and kept 60 MXN (in bills).</p>
<p>You can also get the same amounts by using bean-query to achieve the
same thing:</p>
<pre><code>~/p/.../examples/sharing$ bean-query cozumel2015.beancount

Input file: "Mexico Trip: Cozumel &amp; Tulum SCUBA Diving"

</code></pre>
<h3 id="splitting-expenses"><a id="splitting-expenses"></a>Splitting Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#splitting-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>The expenses side of the Income Statement shows the breakdown of
expenses. Note how some of the expense accounts are explicitly booked to
each member separately by their account name, e.g.,
“Expenses:Scuba:Martin”. The other accounts, e.g. “Expenses:Groceries”
are intended to be split.</p>
<p>How we’re going to carry this out is by adding a plugin that will
transform all the transactions to <em>actually</em> split the postings which
are intended to be shared, that is, postings without any member’s name
as a component. For example, the following input transaction:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-28 * "Scuba Club Cozumel" | "Room bill"
  Income:Martin:CreditCard         -1380.40 USD
  Expenses:Scuba:Martin              178.50 USD
  Expenses:Accommodation            1201.90 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Will be transformed by the plugin into one like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-28 * "Scuba Club Cozumel" | "Room bill"
  Income:Martin:CreditCard         -1380.40 USD
  Expenses:Scuba:Martin              178.50 USD
  Expenses:Accommodation:Martin      600.95 USD
  Expenses:Accommodation:Caroline    600.95 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only Expenses accounts get split into multiple postings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accounts with the name of a member are assumed by convention to be
    already attributed to that person. In order to achieve this, the
    plugin has to be provided with the names of the members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the resulting Income and Expenses accounts include the name of a
    member.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The plugin is enabled like this:</p>
<pre><code>plugin "beancount.plugins.split_expenses" "Martin Caroline"
</code></pre>
<p>Reloading the web page after uncommenting this line from the input file
and visiting the Income Statement page should show a long list of
Expenses accounts split by person. Now, in order to generate the total
amount of expenses incurred for each person, we have to produce the
balance of all Expenses accounts with a member’s name in it, accounts
like “Expenses:.*Martin”.</p>
<p>The web tool does not provide such a filtering capability at the
moment[^1], but we can use the bean-query tool to produce the total of
expenses for each person:</p>
<pre><code>beancount&gt; SELECT sum(position) WHERE account ~ '^Expenses:.*Martin'

sum_positio
-----------
2007.43 USD
3837.0  MXN

beancount&gt; SELECT sum(position) WHERE account '^Expenses:.*Caroline'

sum_positio
-----------
1686.97 USD
3637.0  MXN
</code></pre>
<p>This says “Martin accrued expenses of 2007.43 USD and 3837.0 MXN.”</p>
<p>You can manually convert this to a dollar amount:</p>
<pre><code>yuzu:~$ dc -e '2007.43 3837.0 13.465 / +p'
2291.43
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can use the recently introduced “CONVERT” function of bean-query
to do this:</p>
<pre><code>beancount&gt; SELECT convert(sum(position), 'USD') WHERE account ~ '^Expenses:.*Martin'

     convert_sum_position_c_     
---------------------------------
2288.528901098901098901098901 USD

beancount&gt; SELECT convert(sum(position), 'USD') WHERE account ~ '^Expenses:.*Caroline'

     convert_sum_position_c_     
---------------------------------
1953.416886446886446886446886 USD
</code></pre>
<p>(The difference between the 2291.43 and 2288.53 amounts can be
attributed to the usage of slightly different exchange rates used in the
converting transactions.)</p>
<p>Similarly, you can generate the list of payments made by each person,
e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>beancount&gt; SELECT sum(position) WHERE account ~ '^Income:.*Caroline'
</code></pre>
<h2 id="final-transfer"><a id="final-transfer"></a>Final Transfer<a class="headerlink" href="#final-transfer" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In order to figure out the total amount owed by each member, the process
is similar: Simply sum up the balances of all the accounts attributed to
that particular member:</p>
<pre><code>beancount&gt; SELECT convert(sum(position), 'USD') WHERE account ~ 'Caroline'

     convert_sum_position_c_     
---------------------------------
1538.783186813186813186813187 USD

beancount&gt; SELECT convert(sum(position), 'USD') WHERE account ~ 'Martin'

     convert_sum_position_c_      
----------------------------------
-1546.355494505494505494505494 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that this includes the Income and Expenses accounts for that
person. It’s as if we had two separate ledgers merged into one. (Once
again, the small differences can be attributed to differences in
exchange rate over time.)</p>
<p>We can now make a final transfer amount in order to account for each of
our expenses; we’ve agreed to round this to 1500 USD:</p>
<pre><code>2015-03-06 * "Final transfer from Caroline to Martin to pay for difference"
  Income:Caroline:Wallet                    -1500 USD
  Income:Martin:Wallet                       1500 USD
</code></pre>
<p>If you uncomment this transaction from the input file (near the end),
you will find corrected balances:</p>
<pre><code>beancount&gt; SELECT convert(sum(position), 'USD') WHERE account ~ 'Martin'

<p>So great! Now we’ve reconciled each other for the trip. But you still
need to reflect these expenses in your personal ledger (if you have
one). In this section, I will explain how you should reflect these
transactions in that file.</p>
<h3 id="account-names"><a id="account-names"></a>Account Names<a class="headerlink" href="#account-names" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>First, let us take note that the accounts in your personal ledger do not
have to match the account names used in the trip’s ledger file. I never
process those files together. (A good argument for not attempting this
is that each trip will include account names from other people and I
prefer not to have those leak into my main ledger file.)</p>
<h3 id="using-a-tag"><a id="using-a-tag"></a>Using a Tag<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-tag" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>I like to use a tag to report on the entire set of transactions related
to the trip. In this example, I used the tag #trip-cozumel2015.</p>
<h3 id="booking-contributions"><a id="booking-contributions"></a>Booking Contributions<a class="headerlink" href="#booking-contributions" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Your contributions into the project should be booked to a temporary
holding account. I call mine “Assets:Travel:Pending”. For example, this
transaction from the trip’s file:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-25 * "Yellow Transfers" | "SuperShuttle to Playa del Carmen"
  Expenses:Transport:Bus                 656 MXN
  Income:Martin:CreditCard            -44.12 USD @ 14.86854 MXN
</code></pre>
<p>will eventually be imported in my personal file and categorized like
this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-25 * "YELLOW TRANSFER MX  CO" #trip-cozumel2015
  Liabilities:US:BofA:CreditCard      -44.12 USD
  Assets:Travel:Pending                44.12 USD
</code></pre>
<p>You can conceptualize this as contributing money to a pending pool of
cash which you will eventually receive expenses from.</p>
<p>The same goes for cash that I brought for the trip:</p>
<pre><code>2015-02-24 * "Taking cash with me on the trip"
  Assets:Cash                             -1200.00 USD
  Assets:Travel:Pending                    1200.00 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Note that absolutely <strong>all</strong> of the transactions related to the trip
should be booked to that one account, including the inter-account
transfers:</p>
<pre><code>2015-03-06 * "Final transfer from Mexico trip" #trip-cozumel2015
  Assets:Google:Wallet                       1500 USD
  Assets:Travel:Pending                      -1500 USD
</code></pre>
<h3 id="booking-expenses"><a id="booking-expenses"></a>Booking Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#booking-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>After the trip is concluded, we want to convert the balance in the
pending account to a list of Expenses. To find the list of expenses for
yourself, you can issue a query like this:</p>
<pre><code>beancount&gt; SELECT account, sum(position) WHERE account ~ '^Expenses:.*:Martin' 
           GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1

            account             sum_positio

Expenses:Scuba:ParkFees:Martin     7.50 USD

                                 189.16 USD
Expenses:Transport:Bus:Martin    709    MXN
Expenses:Transport:Taxi:Martin    53.90 USD
                                 294    MXN
Expenses:Transport:Train:Martin    5.00 USD

<p>I suppose you could script away this part to remove the member’s name
from the account names and have the script spit output already formatted
as a nicely formatted Transaction, but because the account names will
not match the personal ledger file’s 1-to-1, you will have to perform a
manual conversion anyway, so I did not bother automating this.
Furthermore, you only have a single one of these to make after your
trip, so it’s not worth spending too much time making this part
easier[^2].</p>
<p>Here’s what the final transaction looks like; I have a section in my
input file with this:</p>

<p>Observations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I used “event” directives in order to track my location. I’m doing
    this because I will eventually need it for immigration purposes (and
    just for fun, to track the days I spend in places).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I moved the extra cash I kept to my “foreign cash pocket” account:
    Assets:Cash:Foreign</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I “moved” back the cash I had with me after I returned from the
    trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This leg removes the USD expenses from the Pending account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The leg removes the MXN expenses from the Pending account. I
    calculated its amount manually (3897 / 13.5 ~= 288.67 USD) and use
    the full amount as the exchange rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to completely zero out the Pending account after the trip,
    and so I write off the excess amount we agreed not to pay (the
    difference between the imbalance and 1500.00 USD).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, I assert that the Pending account is empty of USD and of
    MXN.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I found the missing amounts by running bean-check or using bean-doctor
context on an incomplete transaction from Emacs.</p>
<h2 id="generating-reports"><a id="generating-reports"></a>Generating Reports<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-reports" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>If you want to automate the generation of reports for each of the
participants in a trip, there is a script that generates text (and
eventually CSV) reports for the queries mentioned in the previous
sections. You can use this script to provide expenses status after or
even during the trip or project, for each of the participants.</p>
<p>The script lives in the split_expenses plugin itself, and you invoke it
like this:</p>
<pre><code>python3 -m beancount.plugins.split_expenses &lt;beancount-filename&gt; --text=&lt;dir&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For each person, it will generate the following reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A detailed journal of expenses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A detailed journal of contributions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A breakdown of expenses for each category (account type)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, it will also generate a final balance for each person, which
you can use to send final reconciling transfers to each other. Try it
now on one of the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/tip/examples/sharing/"><span class="underline">example
files</span></a>
provided with Beancount.</p>
<h2 id="other-examples"><a id="other-examples"></a>Other Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#other-examples" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>There is another example file that shows how to share expenses between
three participants in <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/66e85c8343d8704745ae16cb6ac622f4b6246c3c/examples/sharing/duxbury2015.beancount?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default"><span
class="underline">duxbury2015.beancount</span></a>.
Look to more example files to be introduced over time.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a id="conclusion"></a>Conclusion<img src="21_sharing_expenses_with_beancount/media/b2573bbadd485ef104e25a4b13b53f46c4b541ca.jpg" style="width:2.02604in;height:1.52427in" /><a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>There is more than just one way to carry out the task we describe here.
However, the method we present extends nicely to a larger group of
participants, allows us to account for situations where particular
expenses are incurred for one individual as part of a group, and
finally, allows for a non-even split between the participants. This is
pretty general.</p>
<p>It’s also a short step to accounting for an ongoing project with a
longer term. The ideas presented in this document provide a nice use
case for the usage of the double-entry method in a simple setting. I
hope that working through this use case will help people develop the
intuitions necessary in using the double-entry method.</p>
<p>[^1]: As our SQL-like query language matures, bean-web will eventually
    allow the user to create views from a set of transactions filtered
    from an expression. This will be implemented eventually.</p>
<p>[^2]: Note that we could implement a special “beancount” supported
    format to the bean-query tool in order to write out balances in
    Transaction form. I’m not sure how useful that would be but it’s an
    idea worth considering for the future.</p></div>
