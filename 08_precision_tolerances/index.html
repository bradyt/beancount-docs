<p><em>This document describes how Beancount handles the limited precision of
numbers in transaction balance checks and balance assertions. It also
documents rounding that may occur in inferring numbers automatically.</em></p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation<a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Beancount automatically enforces that the amounts on the Postings of
Transactions entered in an input file sum up to zero. In order for
Beancount to verify this in a realistic way, it must tolerate a small
amount of imprecision. This is because Beancount lets you <strong>replicate
what happens in real world account transactions</strong>, and in the real
world, institutions round amounts up or down for practical reasons.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: Consider the following transaction which consists in
a transfer between two accounts denominated in different currencies (US
dollars and Euros):</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-01 * "Transfer from secret Swiss bank account"
  Assets:CH:SBS:Checking   -9000.00 CHF
  Assets:US:BofA:Checking   9643.82 USD @ 0.93324 CHF
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the exchange rate used was 0.93324 USD/CHF, that is,
0.93324 Swiss Francs per US dollar. This rate was quoted to 5 digits of
precision by the bank. A full-precision conversion of 9000.00 CHF /
0.93324 CHF yields <strong>9643.82152501...</strong> USD. Similarly, converting the
US dollars to Francs using the given rate yields an imprecise result as
well: 9643.82 x 0.93324 = <strong>8999.9985768…</strong> .</p>
<p>Here is another example where this type of rounding may occur: A
transaction for a fractional number of shares of a mutual fund:</p>
<pre><code>2013-04-03 * "Buy Mutual Fund - Price as of date based on closing price"
  Assets:US:Vanguard:RGAGX       10.22626 RGAGX {37.61 USD}
  Assets:US:Vanguard:Cash         -384.61 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Once again, rounding occurs in this transaction: not only the Net Asset
Value of the fund is rounded to its nearest penny value ($37.61), but
the number of units is also rounded and accounted for by Vanguard with a
fixed number of digits (10.22626 units of VPMBX). And the balance of the
entire transaction needs to tolerate some imprecision, whether you
compute the value of the shares (10.22626 x $37.61 = <strong>$384.6096386</strong>)
or whether you compute the number of shares from the desired dollar
amount of the contribution ($384.61 / $37.61 = <strong>10.2262696091</strong>).</p>
<p>From Beancount’s point-of-view, both of the examples above are balancing
transactions. Clearly, if we are to try to represent and reproduce the
transactions of external accounts to our input file, there needs to be
some tolerance in the balance verification algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="how-precision-is-determined">How Precision is Determined<a class="headerlink" href="#how-precision-is-determined" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Beancount attempts to derive the precision from each transaction
<strong>automatically</strong>, from the input, for each Transaction <strong>in
isolation</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. Let us inspect our last example again:</p>
<pre><code>2013-04-03 * "Buy Mutual Fund - Price as of date based on closing price"
  Assets:US:Vanguard:RGAGX       10.22626 RGAGX {37.61 USD}
  Assets:US:Vanguard:Cash         -384.61 USD
</code></pre>
<p>In this transaction, Beancount will infer the tolerance of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>RGAGX at 5 fractional digits, that is, <strong>0.000005 RGAGX</strong>, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>USD at 2 fractional digits, that is, <strong>0.005 USD</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the tolerance used is <strong>half of the last digit of precision</strong>
provided by the user. This is entirely inferred from the input, without
having to fetch any global tolerance declaration. Also note how the
precision is calculated <strong>separately for each currency</strong>.</p>
<p>Observe that although we are inferring a tolerance for units of RGAGX,
it is actually not used in the balancing of this transaction, because
the “weight” of the first posting is in USD (10.22626 x 37.61 =
384.6096386 USD).</p>
<p>So what happens here? The weights of each postings are calculated:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>384.6096386 USD for the first posting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-384.61 USD for the second</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are summed together, by currency (there is only USD in the weights
of this transaction) which results in a <em>residual</em> value of -0.0003614
USD. This value is compared to the tolerance for units of USD:
|-0.0003614| &lt; 0.005, and this transaction balances.</p>
<h3 id="prices-and-costs">Prices and Costs<a class="headerlink" href="#prices-and-costs" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>For the purpose of inferring the tolerance to be used, the price and
cost amounts declared on a transaction’s Postings <strong>are ignored</strong>. This
makes sense if you consider that these are usually specified at a higher
precision than the base amounts of the postings—and sometimes this extra
precision is necessary to make the transaction balance. These should not
be used in setting the precision of the whole transaction.</p>
<p>For example, in the following transaction:</p>
<pre><code>1999-09-30 * "Vest ESPP - Bought at discount: 18.5980 USD"
     Assets:US:Schwab:ESPP            54 HOOL {21.8800 USD}
     Income:CA:ESPP:PayContrib  -1467.84 CAD @ 0.6842 USD
     Income:CA:ESPP:Discount     -259.03 CAD @ 0.6842 USD
</code></pre>
<p>The only tolerance inferred here is 0.005 for CAD. (54 HOOL does not
yield anything in this case because it is integral; the next section
explains this). There is no tolerance inferred for USD, neither from the
cost from the first posting (21.8800 USD), nor from the prices of the
remaining postings (0.6842 USD).</p>
<h3 id="integer-amounts">Integer Amounts<a class="headerlink" href="#integer-amounts" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>For integer amounts in the input, the precision is <strong>not</strong> inferred to
0.5, that is, this should fail to balance:</p>
<pre><code>2013-04-03 * "Buy Mutual Fund - Price as of date based on closing price"
  Assets:US:Vanguard:RGAGX    10.21005 RGAGX {37.61 USD}
  Assets:US:Vanguard:Cash         -384 USD
</code></pre>
<p>In other words, integer amounts do not contribute a number of digits to
the determination of the tolerance for their currency.</p>
<p>By default, the tolerance used on amounts without an inferred precision
is <strong>zero</strong>. So in this example, because we cannot infer the precision
of USD (recall that the cost is ignored), this transaction will fail to
balance, because its residual is non-zero (|-0.0003614| &gt; 0).</p>
<p>You can customize what the default tolerance should be for each currency
separately and for any currency as well (see section below on how to do
this).</p>
<p>This treatment of integer amounts implies that the <strong>maximum amount of
precision</strong> that one can specify just by inputting numbers is 0.05 units
of the currency, for example, by providing a number such as 10.7 as
input<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. On the other hand, the settings for the default tolerance to
use allows specifying arbitrary numbers.</p>
<h3 id="resolving-ambiguities">Resolving Ambiguities<a class="headerlink" href="#resolving-ambiguities" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>A case that presents itself rarely is one where multiple different
precisions are being input for the same currency. In this case, the
<strong>largest</strong> (coarsest) of the inferred input tolerances is used.</p>
<p>For example, if we wanted to track income to more than pennies, we might
write this:</p>
<pre><code>1999-08-20 * "Sell"
  Assets:US:BRS:ESPP           -81 HOOL {26.3125 USD}
  Assets:US:BRS:Cash       2141.36 USD
  Expenses:Financial:Fees     0.08 USD
  Income:CA:ESPP:PnL       -10.125 USD
</code></pre>
<p>The amounts we have for USD in this case are 2141.36, 0.08 and -10.125,
which infer tolerances of either 0.005 or 0.0005. We select the coarsest
amount: this transaction tolerates an imprecision of 0.005 USD.</p>
<h3 id="default-tolerances">Default Tolerances<a class="headerlink" href="#default-tolerances" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>When a transaction’s numbers do not provide enough information to infer
a tolerance <em>locally</em>, we fall back to some default tolerance value. As
seen in previous examples, this may occur either because (a) the numbers
associated with the currency we need it for are integral, or (b)
sufficient numbers are simply absent from the input.</p>
<p>By default, this default tolerance is <strong>zero</strong> for all currencies. This
can be specified with an option, like this:</p>
<pre><code>option "inferred_tolerance_default" "*:0.001"
</code></pre>
<p>The default tolerance can be further refined for each currency involved,
by providing the currency to the option, like this:</p>
<pre><code>option "inferred_tolerance_default" "USD:0.003"
</code></pre>
<p>If provided, the currency-specific tolerance will be used over the
global value.</p>
<p>The general form for this option is:</p>
<pre><code>option "inferred_tolerance_default" "&lt;currency&gt;:&lt;tolerance&gt;"
</code></pre>
<p>Just to be clear: this option is <em>only</em> used when the tolerance cannot
be inferred. If you have overly large rounding errors and the numbers in
your transactions do infer some tolerance value, this value will be
ignored (e.g., setting it to a larger number to try to address that fix
will not work). If you need to loosen up the tolerance, see the
“inferred_tolerance_multiplier” in the next section.</p>
<p><em>(Note: I’ve been considering dedicating a special meta-data field to
the Commodity directive for this, but this would break from the
invariant that meta-data is only there to be used by users and plugins,
so I’ve refrained so far.)</em></p>
<h3 id="tolerance-multiplier">Tolerance Multiplier<a class="headerlink" href="#tolerance-multiplier" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>We’re shown previously that when the tolerance value isn’t provided
explicitly, that it is inferred from the numbers on the postings. By
default, the smallest digit found on those numbers is divided by half to
obtain the tolerance because we assume that the institutions which we’re
reproducing the transactions apply rounding and so the error should
never be more than half.</p>
<p>But in reality, you may find that the rounding errors sometime exceed
this value. For this reason, we provide an option to set the multiplier
for the inferred tolerance:</p>
<pre><code>option "inferred_tolerance_multiplier" "1.2"
</code></pre>
<p>This value overrides the default multiplier. In this example, for a
transaction with postings only with values such as 24.45 CHF, the
inferred tolerance for CHF would be +/- 0.012 CHF.</p>
<h3 id="inferring-tolerances-from-cost">Inferring Tolerances from Cost<a class="headerlink" href="#inferring-tolerances-from-cost" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>There is also a feature that expands the maximum tolerance inferred on
transactions to include values on cost currencies inferred by postings
held at-cost or converted at price. Those postings can imply a tolerance
value by multiplying the smallest digit of the unit by the cost or price
value and taking half of that value.</p>
<p>For example, if a posting has an amount of "2.345 RGAGX {45.00 USD}"
attached to it, it implies a tolerance of 0.001 x 45.00 / 2 = 0.045 USD
and the sum of all such possible rounding errors is calculate for all
postings held at cost or converted from a price, and the resulting
tolerance is added to the list of candidates used to figure out the
tolerance we should use for the given commodity (we use the maximum
value of all the inferred tolerances).</p>
<p>You turn on the feature like this:</p>
<pre><code>option "infer_tolerance_from_cost" "TRUE"
</code></pre>
<p>Enabling this flag only makes the tolerances potentially wider, never
smaller.</p>
<h2 id="balance-assertions-padding">Balance Assertions &amp; Padding<a class="headerlink" href="#balance-assertions-padding" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>There are a few other places where approximate comparisons are needed.
Balance assertions also compare two numbers:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-08 balance Assets:Investments:RGAGX       4.271 RGAGX
</code></pre>
<p>This asserts that the accumulated balance for this account has 4.271
units of RGAGX, plus or minus 0.001 RGAGX. So accumulated values of
4.270 RGAGX up to 4.272 RGAGX will check as asserted.</p>
<p>The tolerance is inferred automatically to be 1 unit of the least
significant digit of the number on the balance assertion. If you wanted
a looser assertion, you could have declared:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-08 balance Assets:Investments:RGAGX       4.27 RGAGX
</code></pre>
<p>This assertion would accept values from 4.26 RGAGX to 4.28 RGAGX.</p>
<p>Note that the inferred tolerances are also expanded by the inferred
tolerance multiplier discussed above.</p>
<h3 id="tolerances-that-trigger-padding">Tolerances that Trigger Padding<a class="headerlink" href="#tolerances-that-trigger-padding" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Pad directives automatically insert transactions to bring account
balances in-line with a subsequent balance assertion. The insertion only
triggers if the balance differs from the expected value, and the
tolerance for this to occur behaves exactly the same as for balance
assertions.</p>
<h3 id="explicit-tolerances-on-balance-assertions">Explicit Tolerances on Balance Assertions<a class="headerlink" href="#explicit-tolerances-on-balance-assertions" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Beancount supports the specification of an explicit tolerance amount,
like this:</p>
<pre><code>2015-05-08 balance Assets:Investments:RGAGX       4.271 ~ 0.01 RGAGX
</code></pre>
<p>This feature was added because of some observed peculiarities in
Vanguard investment accounts whereby rounding appears to follow odd
rules and balances don’t match.</p>
<h2 id="saving-rounding-error">Saving Rounding Error<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-rounding-error" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>As we saw previously, transactions don’t have to balance exactly, they
allow for a small amount of imprecision. This bothers some people. If
you would like to track and measure the residual amounts allowed by the
tolerances, Beancount offers an option to automatically insert postings
that will make each transaction balance exactly.</p>
<p>You enable the feature like this:</p>
<pre><code>option "account_rounding" "Equity:RoundingError"
</code></pre>
<p>This tells Beancount to insert postings to compensate for the rounding
error to an “Equity:RoundingError” account. For example, with the
feature enabled, the following transaction:</p>
<pre><code>2013-02-23 * "Buying something"
  Assets:Invest     1.245 RGAGX {43.23 USD}
  Assets:Cash      -53.82 USD
</code></pre>
<p>will be automatically transformed into this:</p>
<pre><code>2013-02-23 * "Buying something"
  Assets:Invest             1.245 RGAGX {43.23 USD}
  Assets:Cash              -53.82 USD
  Equity:RoundingError   -0.00135 USD
</code></pre>
<p>You can verify that this transaction balances exactly. If the
transaction already balances exactly (this is the case for most
transactions) no posting is inserted.</p>
<p>Finally, if you require that all accounts be opened explicitly, you
should remember to declare the rounding account in your file at an
appropriate date, like this:</p>
<pre><code>2000-01-01 open Equity:RoundingError
</code></pre>
<h2 id="precision-of-inferred-numbers">Precision of Inferred Numbers<a class="headerlink" href="#precision-of-inferred-numbers" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Beancount is able to infer some missing numbers in the input. For
example, the second posting in this transaction is “interpolated”
automatically by Beancount:</p>
<pre><code>2014-05-06 * "Buy mutual fund"
  Assets:Investments:RGXGX        4.27 RGAGX {53.21 USD}
  Assets:Investments:Cash
</code></pre>
<p>The calculated amount to be inserted from the first posting is -227.2067
USD. Now, you might ask, to which precision is it inserted at? Does it
insert 227.2067 USD at the full precision or does the number get rounded
to a penny, e.g. 227.21 USD?</p>
<p>It depends on the tolerance inferred for that currency. In this example,
no tolerance is able to get inferred (there is no USD amount provided
other than the cost amount, which is ignored for the purpose of
inferring the tolerance), so we have to defer to the default tolerance.</p>
<p>If the default tolerance is not overridden in the input file—and
therefore is zero—the full precision will be used; no rounding occurs.
This will result in the following transaction:</p>
<pre><code>2014-05-06 * "Buy mutual fund"
  Assets:Investments:RGXGX        4.27 RGAGX {53.21 USD}
  Assets:Investments:Cash    -227.2067 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if a tolerance could be inferred from other numbers on that
transaction, it would be used for rounding, such as in this example
where the Cash posting is rounded to two digits because of the 9.95 USD
number on the Commissions posting:</p>
<pre><code>2014-05-06 * "Buy mutual fund"
  Assets:Investments:RGXGX        4.27 RGAGX {53.21 USD}
  Expenses:Commissions            9.95 USD
  Assets:Investments:Cash      -237.16 USD
</code></pre>
<p>However, if no inference is possible, and the default tolerance for USD
is set to 0.001, the number will be quantized to 0.001 before insertion,
that is, 227.207 USD will be stored:</p>
<pre><code>option "default_tolerance" "USD:0.001"

2014-05-06 * "Buy mutual fund"
  Assets:Investments:RGXGX        4.27 RGAGX {53.21 USD}
  Assets:Investments:Cash     -227.207 USD
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, if you enabled the accumulation of rounding error, the
posting’s amount will reflect the correct residual, taking into account
the rounded amount that was automatically inserted:</p>
<pre><code>option "default_tolerance" "USD:0.01"
option "account_rounding" "Equity:RoundingError"

2014-05-06 * "Buy mutual fund"
  Assets:Investments:RGXGX        4.27 RGAGX {53.21 USD}
  Assets:Investments:Cash     -227.207 USD
  Equity:RoundingError          0.0003 USD
</code></pre>
<h2 id="porting-existing-input">Porting Existing Input<a class="headerlink" href="#porting-existing-input" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The inference of tolerance values from the transaction’s numbers is
generally good enough to keep existing files working without changes.
There may be new errors appearing in older files once we process them
with the method described in this document, but they should either point
to previously undetected errors in the input, or be fixable with simple
addition of a suitable number of digits.</p>
<p>As a testimony, porting the author’s very large input file has been a
relatively painless process that took less than 1 hour.</p>
<p>In order to ease the transition, you will probably want to change the
default tolerance for all currencies to match the previous value that
Beancount had been using, like this:</p>
<pre><code>option "inferred_tolerance_default" "*:0.005"
</code></pre>
<p>I would recommend you start with this and fix all errors in your file,
then proceed to removing this and fix the rest of errors. This should
make it easier to adapt your file to this new behavior.</p>
<p>As an example of how to fix a new error… converting this newly failing
transaction from the Integer Amounts section:</p>
<pre><code>2013-04-03 * "Buy Mutual Fund - Price as of date based on closing price"
  Assets:US:Vanguard:RGAGX    10.21005 RGAGX {37.61 USD}
  Assets:US:Vanguard:Cash         -384 USD
</code></pre>
<p>by inserting zero’s to provide a locally inferred value like this:</p>
<pre><code>2013-04-03 * "Buy Mutual Fund - Price as of date based on closing price"
  Assets:US:Vanguard:RGAGX    10.21005 RGAGX {37.61 USD}
  Assets:US:Vanguard:Cash      -384.00 USD
</code></pre>
<p>is sufficient to silence the balance check.</p>
<h2 id="representational-issues">Representational Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#representational-issues" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Internally, Beancount uses a decimal number representation (not a
binary/float representation, neither rational numbers). Calculations
that result in a large number of fractional digits are carried out to 28
decimal places (the default precision from the context of Python’s IEEE
decimal implementation). This is plenty sufficient, because the method
we propose above rarely trickles these types of numbers throughout the
system: the tolerances allows us to post the precise amounts declared by
users, and only automatically derived prices and costs will possibly
result in precisions calculated to an unrealistic number of digits that
could creep into aggregations in the rest of the system.</p>

<p>Note that for the longest time, Beancount used a fixed precision of
0.005 across all currencies. This was eliminated once the method
described in this document was implemented.</p>
<p>Also, for Balance and Pad directives, there used to be a “tolerance”
option that was set by default to 0.015 of any units. This option has
been deprecated with the merging of the changes described in this

<h2 id="historical-notes">Historical Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#historical-notes" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Here’s an overview of the status of numbers rendering in Beancount as of
March 2016, <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/frfN1zc6TEc/d5OjuDnREgAJ"><span class="underline">from the
mailing-list</span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, it's important to realize how these numbers are represented in
memory. They are using the Decimal representation which beyond being
able to accurately representing decimal numbers (as opposed to the
approximation that binary floats provides) also contains a specific
precision. That is, the number 2.00 is represented differently than
the numbers 2.0 and 2.000. The numbers "remember" which precision they
are represented up to. This is important. When I say rendering the
numbers to their "natural precision" I mean the precision with which
they are represented, i.e., 2.0 renders as "2.0", 2.000 renders as
"2.000".</p>
<p>Then, there are two DISTINCT topics: (1) tolerances, and (2)
precision.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Tolerances" are values used to determine how much imprecision is
    acceptable in balancing transactions. This is used in the
    verification stage, to determine how much looseness to allow. It
    should not affect how numbers are rendered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Precision" is perhaps a bit of a misnomer: By that I'm referring to
    is how many digits the numbers are to be rendered with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time - after the shell was already written - these
concepts weren't well defined in Beancount and I wasn't dealing with
these things consistently. At some point it became clear what I needed
to do and I created a class called "DisplayContext" which could
contain appropriate settings for rendering the precision of numbers
for each currency (each currency tends to have its own most common
rendering precision, e.g. two digits for USD, one digit for MXN, no
digits for JPY and in reports we're typically fine rounding the actual
numbers to that precision). So an instance of this DisplayContext is
automatically instantiated in the parser and in order to avoid the
user having to set these values manually - for Beancount to "do the
right thing" by default - it is able to accumulate (<a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/c349150908078720c7e5ee6bfda644b51ac9543e/src/python/beancount/core/display_context.py?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default#display_context.py-190"><span
class="underline">https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/c349150908078720c7e5ee6bfda644b51ac9543e/src/python/beancount/core/display_context.py?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default#display_context.py-190</span></a>)
the numbers seen and to deduce the most common and maximum number of
digits used from the input, and to use that as the default number of
digits for rendering numbers. The most common format/number of digits
is used to render the number of units, and the maximum number of
digits seen is used to render costs and prices. In addition, this
class also has capabilities for aligning to the decimal dot and to
insert commas on thousands as well. It separates the control of the
formatting from the numbers themselves.</p>
<p>MOST of the code that renders numbers uses the DisplayContext (via the
to_string() methods) to convert the numbers into strings, such as the
web interface and explicit text reports. But NOT ALL... there's a bit
of HISTORY here... the SQL shell uses some old special-purpose code
(<a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/c349150908078720c7e5ee6bfda644b51ac9543e/src/python/beancount/query/query_render.py?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default#query_render.py-166"><span
class="underline">https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/c349150908078720c7e5ee6bfda644b51ac9543e/src/python/beancount/query/query_render.py?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default#query_render.py-166</span></a>)
to render numbers that I never bothered to convert to the
DisplayContext class. There's a TODO item here:<a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/c349150908078720c7e5ee6bfda644b51ac9543e/TODO?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default#TODO-312"><span
class="underline">https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/c349150908078720c7e5ee6bfda644b51ac9543e/TODO?at=default&amp;fileviewer=file-view-default#TODO-312</span></a>.
It needs to get converted at some point, but I've neglected doing this
so far because I have much bigger plans for the SQL query engine that
involve a full rewrite of it with many improvements and I figured I'd
do that then. If you recall, the SQL query engine was a prototype, and
actually it works, but it is not well covered by unit tests. My
purpose with it was to discover through usage what would be useful and
to then write a v2 of it that would be much better.</p>
<p>Now, about that PRINT command... this is not intended as a reporting
tool. The printer's purpose is to print input that accurately
represents the content of the transactions. In order to do this, it
needs to render the numbers at their "natural" precision, so that when
they get read back in, they parse into the very same number, that is,
with the same number of digits (even if zeros). For this reason, the
PRINT command does not attempt to render using the DisplayContext
instance derived from the input file - this is on purpose. I could
change that, but then round-trip would break: the rounding resulting
from formatting using the display context may output transactions
which don't balance anymore.</p>
<p>As you can see, it's not an obvious topic... Hopefully this should
allow you to understand what comes out of Beancount in terms of the
precision of the numbers it renders.</p>
<p>Note: "default_tolerances" has been renamed to
"inferred_tolerance_default" recently because the name was too
general and confusing. Old name will work but generate a warning.</p>
<p>I just noticed from your comments and some grepping around that the
"render_commas" option is not used anymore. I'm not sure how that
happened, but I'll go ad fix that right away and set the default value
of the DisplayContext derived from the input.</p>
<p>I should probably also convert the SQL shell rendering to use the
display context regardless of future plans, so that it renders
consistently with all the rest. Not sure I can do that this weekend,
but I'll log a ticket.</p>
<p><span
class="underline">https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/105/context-the-query-rendering-routines-to</span></p>
<p>I hope this helps. You're welcome to ask questions if the above isn't
clear. I'm sorry if this isn't entirely obvious... there's been a fair
bit of history there and there's a lot of code. I should review the
naming of options, I think the tolerance options all have "tolerance"
in their name, but there aren't options to override the rendering and
when I add them they should all have a common name as well.</p>
