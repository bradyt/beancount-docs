<h1 id="how-we-share-expenses">How We Share Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#how-we-share-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h1>
<p><em>This document explains how I share expenses with my wife. This is a bit
involved and I’ve developed a good working system, but it’s not so
simple for most people to do that, so I figured I would take the time to
describe it to help others with designing similar processes for
themselves.</em></p>
<h2 id="context">Context<a class="headerlink" href="#context" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>We’re both working professionals and have decided to share all expenses
2:1, where I pay 2 parts. Roughly this is what we shoot for, this is not
a hard rule, but we track it as if it were rigid, and accept it as a
good base approximation. We have two types of shared expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Shared.</strong> Common expenses between us, e.g., rent, a dinner out
    with friends, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kyle.</strong> Expenses for our child, e.g., daycare, diapers, nanny,
    baby food.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These get handled very differently, because we book our child's expenses
as if it were a separate project on its own. (If you prefer pictures,
there’s a diagram at the end of this document that provides an overview
of the system.)</p>
<h2 id="shared-expenses">Shared Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#shared-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>For our shared expenses, I maintain an account for her on my personal
ledger file. This is simple and I’m not too interested in maintaining a
separate ledger for the totality of our common shared expenses. It’s
sufficient for me to just keep track of her balance on that one account.
You can imagine that account like a credit card (I’m the credit
provider) that she pays off with transfers and also by making her own
shared expenses.</p>
<p>I just declare a Assets:US:Share:Carolyn account on my personal ledger
(blais.beancount).</p>
<h3 id="my-shared-expenses">My Shared Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#my-shared-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Whenever I incur an expense that is for both of us, I book it normally
but I will tag it with #carolyn:</p>
<pre><code>2018-12-23 * "WHISK" "Water refill" #carolyn
  Liabilities:US:Amex:BlueCash  -32.66 USD
  Expenses:Food:Grocery
</code></pre>
<p>This gets automatically converted to:</p>
<pre><code>2018-12-23 * "WHISK" "Water refill" #carolyn
  Liabilities:US:Amex:BlueCash  -32.66 USD
  Expenses:Food:Grocery          19.60 USD
  Assets:US:Share:Carolyn       13.06 USD
    share: TRUE
</code></pre>
<p>This is done by the beancount.plugins.divert_expenses plugin. In this
example, 40% of 32.66 (13.06) gets rerouted to her account. Note that
this is an asset account for me, because she owes this.</p>
<h3 id="her-shared-expenses">Her Shared Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#her-shared-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>We also have to keep track of the money she spends on her own for shared
expenses. Since she’s not a Beancount user, I’ve set up a Google Sheets
doc in which she can add rows to a particular sheet. This sheet has
fields: Date, Description, Account, Amount. I try to keep it simple.</p>
<p>Then, I built an <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/tip/experiments/sharing/extract_sheets.py"><span
class="underline">extract_sheets.py</span></a>
script that can pull down this data automatically and it writes it to a
dedicated file for this, overwriting the entire contents each time. The
contents of this ledger (carolyn.beancount) look like this:</p>
<pre><code>pushtag #carolyn
...
2017-05-21 * "Amazon" "Cotton Mattress Protector in White"
  Expenses:Home:Furniture    199.99 USD
  Assets:US:Share:Carolyn  -199.99 USD
...
poptag #carolyn
</code></pre>
<p>All of those transactions are tagged as #carolyn from the
pushtag/poptag directive. They get translated by the plugin to reduce
the amount by the portion I’m supposed to pay:</p>
<pre><code>2017-05-21 * "Amazon" "Cotton Mattress Protector in White" #carolyn
  Expenses:Home:Furniture    119.99 USD
  Assets:US:Share:Carolyn  -119.99 USD
    share: TRUE
</code></pre>
<p>These postings typically reduce her asset account by that much, and thus
remove the portion she paid for me on these shared expenses.</p>
<p>I generate the file with a single command like this:</p>
<pre><code>extract_sheets.py --tag='carolyn' --sheet='Shared Expenses' '&lt;id&gt;' 'Assets:US:Share:Carolyn' &gt; carolyn.beancount
</code></pre>
<p>In my personal ledger, I include this file to merge those expenses with
my own directives flow. I also define a query to generate a statement
for her account. In blais.beancount:</p>
<pre><code>include "carolyn.beancount"

2020-01-01 query "carolyn" "

</code></pre>
<h3 id="reviewing-statement">Reviewing &amp; Statement<a class="headerlink" href="#reviewing-statement" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In order to produce a statement for her to review (and spot the
occasional mistake in data entry), I simply produce a journal of that
account to a CSV file and upload that to another sheet in the same
Google Sheets doc she inputs her expenses:</p>
<pre><code>bean-query -f csv -o carolyn.csv --numberify $L run carolyn
upload-to-sheets -v --docid="&lt;id&gt;" carolyn.csv:"Shared Account (Read-Only)"
</code></pre>
<p>This makes it easy for her to eyeball all the amounts posted to her
balance with me and point out errors if they occur (some always appear).
Moreover, all the information is in one place—it’s important to keep it
simple. Finally, we can use the collaborative features of Sheets to
communicate, e.g. comments, highlighting text, etc.</p>
<p>Note that this system has the benefit of correctly accruing my expenses,
by reducing my portion on categories for the stuff I pay and by
including her portion on categories for the stuff she pays for.</p>
<h3 id="reconciling-our-shared-expenses">Reconciling our Shared Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#reconciling-our-shared-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, in order to reconcile this account, my wife (or I, but usually
she’s behind) just makes a bank transfer to my account, which I book to
reduce her running account balance:</p>
<pre><code>2019-01-30 * "HERBANK EXT TRNSFR; DIRECTDEP"
  Assets:US:MyBank:Checking  3000 USD
  Assets:US:Share:Carolyn

<p>Typically she's do this every month or two. She'll be fiddling on her
laptop and ask casually "Hey, what's my balance I can do a transfer
now?" It’s all fine to relax about the particulars since the system is
keeping track of everything precisely, so she can send some approximate
amount, it doesn't matter, it'll post to her account.</p>
<h2 id="child-expenses">Child Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#child-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>I designed a very different system to track our child’s expenses. For
Kyle, I’m definitely interested in tracking the total cash flows and
expenses related to him, regardless of who paid for them. It’s
interesting to be able to ask (our ledger) a question like: “How much
did his schooling cost?”, for example, or “How much did we pay in
diapers, in total?”. Furthermore, we tend to pay for different things
for Kyle, e.g. I deal with the daycare expenses (I’m the accounting nerd
after all, so this shouldn’t be surprising), and his mother tends to buy
all the clothing and prepare his food. To have a global picture of all
costs related to him, we need to account for these things correctly.</p>
<p>One interesting detail is that it would be difficult to do this with the
previously described method, because I’d have to have a mirror of all
expense accounts I’d use for him. This would make my personal ledger
really ugly. For example, I want to book diapers to Expenses:Pharmacy,
but I also have my own personal pharmacy expenses. So in theory, to do
that I’d like to have separate accounts for him and me, e.g.,
Expenses:Kyle:Pharmacy and Expenses:Pharmacy. This would have to be done
for all the accounts we use for him. I don't do that.</p>
<h3 id="my-child-expenses-on-my-personal-ledger">My Child Expenses on my Personal Ledger<a class="headerlink" href="#my-child-expenses-on-my-personal-ledger" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Instead of doing that, what I want is for my personal ledger to book all
the expenses I make for him to a single category: Expenses:Kyle, and to
track all the detail in a shared ledger. But I still have to book all
the expenses to some category, and these appear on my personal ledger,
there’s no option (I won’t maintain a separate credit card to pay for
his expenses, that would be overkill, so I have to find a way).</p>
<p>I accomplish this by booking the expenses to my own expenses account, as
usual, but tagging the transaction with #kyle:</p>
<pre><code>2019-02-01 * "AMAZON.COM" "MERCHANDISE - Diapers size 4 for Kyle" #kyle
  Liabilities:US:Amex:BlueCash  -49.99 USD
  Expenses:Pharmacy
</code></pre>
<p>And I have a different plugin that <em>automatically</em> makes the conversion
of those transactions to:</p>
<pre><code>2019-02-01 * "AMAZON.COM" "MERCHANDISE - Diapers size 4 for Kyle" #kyle
 Liabilities:US:Amex:BlueCash  -49.99 USD
 Expenses:Kyle                   49.99 USD
   diverted_account: "Expenses:Pharmacy"
</code></pre>
<p>So from my personal side, all those expenses get booked to my “Kyle
project” account. This is accomplished by the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/tip/beancount/plugins/divert_expenses.py"><span
class="underline">divert_expenses</span></a>
plugin, with this configuration:</p>
<pre><code>plugin "beancount.plugins.divert_expenses" "{                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  'tag': 'kyle',                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
  'account': 'Expenses:Kyle'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
}"
</code></pre>
<p>The “diverted_account” metadata is used to keep track of the original
account, and this is used later by another script that generates a
ledger file decided to my expenses for him (more below).</p>
<h3 id="my-child-expenses-in-kyles-own-ledger">My Child Expenses in Kyle’s own Ledger<a class="headerlink" href="#my-child-expenses-in-kyles-own-ledger" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Now, because we’re considering Kyle’s expenses a project of his own, I
have to maintain a set of ledgers for him. I automatically pull the
transactions I described in the previous section from my personal ledger
and automatically convert them to a file dedicated to his dad (me). This
is done by calling the <a href="https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/tip/experiments/sharing/extract_tagged.py"><span
class="underline">extract_tagged</span></a>
script:</p>
<pre><code>extract_tagged.py blais.beancount '#kyle' 'Income:Dad' --translate "Expenses:Kyle:Mom=Income:Mom" &gt; dad.beancount
</code></pre>
<p>The matching transaction from the previous section would look like this
in it:</p>
<pre><code>2019-02-01 * "AMAZON.COM" "MERCHANDISE - Diapers size 4 for Kyle" #kyle
  Income:Dad      -49.99 USD
  Expenses:Pharmacy   49.99 USD
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the script was able to reconstruct the original account
name in Kyle’s ledger by using the metadata saved by the
divert_expenses plugin in the previous section. It also books the
source of the payment to a single account showing it came from his
father (Income:Dad). There’s no need for me to keep track of which
payment method I used on Kyle’s side (e.g. by credit card), that’s not
important to him.</p>
<p>This ledger contains the sum total of all expenses I’ve made for him to
date. The file gets entirely overwritten each time I run this (this is a
purely generated output, no hand editing is ever done here, if I change
anything I change it in my personal ledger file).</p>
<h3 id="her-child-expenses">Her Child Expenses<a class="headerlink" href="#her-child-expenses" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In order to keep track of her expenses for Kyle, we use the same method
(and programs) as we use for our shared accounts in order to pull a set
of “Carolyn’s expenses for Kyle” from another sheet in the same Google
Sheets doc:</p>
<pre><code>extract_sheets.py --sheet='Kyle Expenses (Regular)' '&lt;id&gt;' 'Income:Mom' &gt; mom.beancount
</code></pre>
<p>This pulls in transactions that look like this:</p>
<pre><code>2018-09-23 * "SPROUT SAN FRANCISCO" "Clothing for Kyle 9-12 months"
  Expenses:Clothing   118.30 USD
  Income:Mom      -118.30 USD
</code></pre>
<p>The expenses accounts are pulled from the sheet—sometimes I have to go
fix that by hand a bit, as they may not track precisely those from our
ledger—and the income shows that the contribution was made by his
mother.</p>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it All Together<a class="headerlink" href="#putting-it-all-together" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Finally, we need to put together all these files. I created a top-level
kyle.beancount file that simple declares all of his account categories
and includes his mom and dad files. We have three files:</p>
<pre><code>dad.beancount
mom.beancount
kyle.beancount -&gt; includes transactions from dad.beancount and mom.beancount
</code></pre>
<p>I can then run bean-web or bean-query on kyle.beancount. There are two
things which are interesting to see on that ledger:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The distribution of Kyle’s expenses, in other words, what’s it
    costing us to raise a child (regardless of who pays).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The difference between our contributions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to reconcile (2), we basically compare the balances of the
Income:Mom and Income:Dad accounts. This can be done “by hand”, visually
(using a calculator), but since Beancount’s API make it so easy to pull
any number from a ledger, I wrote a simple script which does that,
computes the total amount of Income contributions, breaks it down to the
expected numbers based on our chosen breakdown, compares it to each
parent’s actual contribution, and simply prints out the difference:</p>
<pre><code>$ reconcile_shared.py kyle.beancount

Total contributions:                       71009.30

Dad expected contribution:              42605.58
Dad actual contribution:                42906.58

Mom expected contribution:              28403.72
Mom actual contribution:                28102.72

Mom OWES Dad:       301.00
</code></pre>
<p>After reconciling, the final number should be zero.</p>
<h3 id="reconciling-the-child-ledger">Reconciling the Child Ledger<a class="headerlink" href="#reconciling-the-child-ledger" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>In order to account for the difference and make the contributions to
Kyle’s upbringing in line with our mutual arrangement of 60%/40%, in the
previous section, my wife would need to transfer $301 to me. Of course,
we don’t <em>actually</em> transfer anything in practice, I just add a virtual
transfer to book the difference to her shared account on my ledger. To
do this, all I have to do is insert a transaction in blais.beancount
that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>2019-02-09 * "Transfer to reconcile Kyle's expenses" #kyle
  Assets:US:Share:Carolyn         301.00 USD
  Expenses:Kyle:Mom
</code></pre>
<p>When this gets pulled into dad.beancount (as explained previously), it
looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>2019-02-09 * "Transfer to reconcile Kyle's expenses" #kyle
  Income:Mom             -301.00 USD
  Income:Dad              301.00 USD
</code></pre>
<p>After that, going back to the Kyle ledger, pulling in all the
transactions again (this is done by using a Makefile) would show an
updated balance of 0:</p>
<pre><code>$ reconcile_shared.py kyle.beancount

Total contributions:                       71009.30

Dad expected contribution:              42605.58
Dad actual contribution:                42605.58

Mom expected contribution:              28403.72
Mom actual contribution:                28403.72

Mom OWES Dad:       301.00
</code></pre>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-system">Summary of the System<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-of-the-system" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Here’s a diagram that puts in perspective the entire system together:</p>
<p><img src="22_how_we_share_expenses/media/4c38b552619d4f280449758db07c5c01dade8f77.png" style="width:8.79167in;height:6.94444in" /></p>
<p>I (“Dad”) use Beancount via Emacs, exclusively. Carolyn (“Mom”) only
interacts with a single Google Sheets doc with three sheets in it. I
pull in Carolyn’s shared expenses from a sheet that she fills in to a
ledger which gets included in my personal ledger. I also pull in her
expenses for Kyle in a similar document, and from my personal ledger I
generate my own expenses for Kyle. Both of these documents are merged in
a top-level ledger dedicated to Kyle’s expenses.</p>
<p>I’m not going to claim it’s simple and that it’s always up-to-date. I
tend to update all of these things once/quarter and fix a few input
errors each time we review it. I automate much of it via Makefiles, but
frankly I don’t update it frequently enough to just remember where all
the moving pieces are, so every time, there’s a bit of scrambling and
reading my makefiles and figuring out what’s what (in fact, I was
motivated to write this to cement my understanding solidly for the
future). Amazingly enough, it hasn’t broken at all and I find all the
pieces every time and make it work.</p>
<p>And we have enough loose change between the two of us that it’s never
that urgent to reconcile every week. My wife tends to pay more shared
expenses and I tend to pay more Kyle’s expenses, so I often end up doing
a transfer from one to the other to even things out and it’s relatively
close—the shortfall in Kyle expenses makes up for my shortfall on the
shared expenses.</p>

double-entry bookkeeping method. Please write questions and comments on
